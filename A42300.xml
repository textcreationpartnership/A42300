            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Principles formerly were accounted Sulphur, Copper, Iron, and a little Marcaſite; of late, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen, Nitre, and ſome Sulphur, which laſt I endeavour to Confirm, with the Addition of many more, which will partly Conſtitute, and partly evidence the Nature of theſe

            <p>And although my Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines me rather to a diffidence, than preſumption on any thing that is my own, yet I muſt be ſo far confident as to believe, that the Exiſtence of Nitre in the Waters of <hi>Bathe,</hi> ſo much queſtion'd by ſome, and my particular Concern, is ſo fully eſtabliſht by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Experiments, made with my own hands, as to keep thoſe words upright in my late Letter to your ſelf, wherein I aſſert it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable. And whoever ſhall take the pains to ſatisfie himſelf in that
<pb facs="tcp:100351:7"/> Particular, as I have done, and ſhall let me know wherein he is diſſatisfied, and can convince me to the Contrary, whom I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he ſhall not find obſtinate, he ſhall have the Honour, if that be any thing, of making me his Convert, (for I think my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Reputation a ſmall Sacrifice on the Altar of Truth;) but if not, it will appear, which is no great matter on either hand, that ſome Body hath been miſtaken.</p>
            <p>However the Satisfaction is not little, nor the Omen bad, that I have already gained the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a Perſon ſo Judicious as your ſelf, who have formerly taken pains on the ſame Account, and on which ſide ſoever the Scales ſhall turn, I have had this

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Reader may be acquainted with the occaſion, time, and manner of my making theſe Enquiries (which are not haſty concluſions, but the product of more mature conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) I ſhall here premiſe ſomething concerning that, and alſo diſcourſe of, as more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this place, ſome other matters tending to the enlargement of the Reputation, and uſefulneſs of the Waters.</p>
            <p>Taking therefore into conſideration the performances of ſome before me, and the attempts of others, in my time, which were not ſatisfactory, and having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a more retired nature, and conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence on the place, with thoſe Conveniencies which ſome others have not had, I thought it worth my while to employ my leiſure hours in ſome Experiments on
<pb facs="tcp:100351:9"/> the Waters, which none had done before to any great purpoſe, the Waters having hitherto been rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd than underſtood, if ſo I might give my own Curioſity ſatisfaction in that affair. And indeed, no vain glorious humour of deſiring to be Popular, which I never affected, nor itch to have my Name in print, which hath been already ſufficiently done by the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my friends, and therefore needs not any labour of my own again, was the occaſion of my entring on this undertaking; but obſerving the Bath-water was drank by ſome, and probably like to advance, I could not ſatisfie my ſelf in adviſing my Patients to it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I had firſt made a particular ſearch into what it did contain, it ſeeming as abſurd to me to tell my friends tbat depended on my judgment for their health and preſervation, they ſhould drink the Bath-water, which I knew nothing of, as to adviſe them to the uſe of ſuch Spirits, Pills, or any other Medicine, I was ignorant of the compoſition of, or had procured from others.</p>
            <p>Had I found this done to my hand, I could well have diſpenſed witb the confinement and riſque this deſign hath occaſion'd, and ſpent theſe hours I have done in my Study, as chearfully elſewhere, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little ſatisfaction in what had been before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, I firſt made collection out of the beſt Mineral Authors, ſuch as <hi>Fallopius, Agricola, Baccius,</hi> and others, what was the beſt way to obtain a Sediment out of any Water, and then how to know of what that ſediment did conſiſt, making application of this Theory to the Waters of this place.</p>
            <p>Obſerving then the waies of gaining a Sediment to be chiefly ſour, <hi>Evaporation, Diſtillation, Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Inſolation,</hi> the laſt, as too laborious, I thought fit to wave, and reſolved on the other three, Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating precipitating, and diſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:100351:9"/> of all the Baths, which gave me encouragement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to greater.</p>
            <p>Having obtained a Sediment, which I call the <hi>Contents</hi> of the Water, the very Notion of which was but lately a ſtranger here, I truſted not to my ſingle judgment, but made it known to the beſt Phyſicians of my acquaintance, with whom I had Converſe, particularly my ever honoured friend Sr. <hi>Edward Greaves,</hi> whoſe encouragement to this deſign hath not been little, and alſo addreſsed my ſelf in writing to the very Ingenious and Eminent Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> (whoſe loſs all Ingenious Philoſophers and Phyſicians muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his many thoughts now dying with him) whoſe aſſiſtance I deſired by Letter dated <hi>1.

                  <p>HEaring nothing of <hi>Colonel Morgan,</hi> the Perſon I deſigned for conveyance of what I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly promiſed, I have now met with a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opportunity by my vvorthy friend Mr. <hi>Alex. Dyer</hi> to preſent you with as true an Anatomy of the Baths, as my preſent inſpection will permit: <hi>viz.</hi> The Contents of all the Baths, <hi>Kings, Croſs</hi> and <hi>Hot,</hi> in Iron and Glaſs Veſſels; the former ℥i. of each, the latter ℥ii. or thereabouts; that in Glaſs being all that one Gallon of the Water of each Bath did afford; the other in Iron, not the whole quantity,
<pb facs="tcp:100351:10"/> but ſufficient, I hope, for your ſatisfaction, that came from four Gallons, the <hi>Kings Bath</hi> yielding in Iron, on my firſt Experiment <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>xiiii; the <hi>Croſs</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>xii ſs; the <hi>Hot</hi> ℥ix. ℈ii: but on my ſecond Trial performed in the late wet weather, much leſs out of the ſame veſſel, and quantity of water, which may ſuggeſt ſomething to Enquiry if I find it hold. But uſually out of 4 Gallons in a Veſſel of mixt Mettal, I commonly evaporate it in, I have ℥i. out of a gallon of all the Baths alike, ſo that I judge about <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. to be the common proportion out of a gallon the Water will afford.</p>
                  <p>Now of theſe <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii, as I ſuppoſe, you will eaſily diſcover all is not Salt, but according to my beſt obſervation I find a third part only Saline, or ℈ii. in <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii: the reſidue, which I have ſent under the name of <hi>Reſiduum Sedimenti non Salinum,</hi> will not relent but continues of a gritty nature, and I ſuppoſe, conſiſts of two different ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ochre</hi> ariſeth in a large quantity, where the ſtream of the Bath meets with any reſiſtance; but what I am not ſo fully ſatisfied in for the preſent is, that though ſo much continually is breathed out of the water, nothing yellow is diſcovered in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Oleum Salis Thermarum per deliquium,</hi> is only that Salt I have ſent you by the name of <hi>Sal Thermarum</hi> relented in the air, and cleanſed from impurities that will ſubſide, but tincted greeniſh by a touch of Copper it met with in extracting, when otherwiſe the true colour is more inclining to Amber.</p>
                  <p>One thing more alſo I think fit to advertiſe you of, that in Glaſs Veſſels there is a thin cruſt in the outſide covering that part that is moſt Saline, as thin as the thinneſt Wafer, but not Salt at all,
<pb facs="tcp:100351:11"/> which I have cauſed to be ſeparated in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the <hi>Hot Bath,</hi> and put in a diſtinct glaſs containing <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. gr. 10; this more flakey and much leſs, if at all Saline, being only ℈ii. gr. 14. The <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Croſs Bath</hi> are alike, mixed here in one glaſs, only the <hi>Hoth Bath</hi> ſeparated for your further ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>You have alſo the Sand, Mud, and Scum, in Boxes by themſelves, all which I ſubmit to your more exact ſcrutiny what names to call theſe by, which is the grand thing in queſtion, and <hi>on which will be built, as I conceive, the trueſt Hypotheſis of the Nature and Vertues of theſe Waters that hath yet been given, and much different from what hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſuppoſed and preſumed on.</hi>

               <p>The Doctors buſineſs being much on other accounts, I cannot underſtand he did any thing in this, only in a Latin Letter he had occaſion to write me not long after, on the account of an Honourable Patient, for whom we then were both concern'd he takes a very kind notice of my Letters, and Experiments, and gives me thanks in this expreſſion, <hi>Clariſſime Domine, Multum Tibi debeo pro Litteris &amp; Experimentis Tuis circa Aquas Thermales mihi jam pridem miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, quae officia Tua ut gratiſſima habeo, ita compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare ſtudebo;</hi> but ſent me no other ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>A little after, having an opportunity of obtaining the Contents of many Hogſheads of the Water, I wrought them all of, and came to an exact ſeparation and diſtinction of Particulars, as expreſsed in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations hereunto annexed, and as occaſion ſerved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated my Experiments to my Honoured friends, the Learned and accompliſht Sr. <hi>Charles Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> Doctor <hi>Thomas Witherley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Nathaniel Highmore,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Thomas Harbech.</hi> This I think is ſufficient to take off the ſurmiſe of Singularity, if any ſuch thing by chance ſhould be thought upon.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but admire how a Judicious man ſhould be ſo far impoſed on by any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as to imagine, that a ſatisfactory enquiry into the nature of theſe Waters was ſo nice a ſpeculation, as to be <hi>inconvenient</hi> or <hi>uſeleſs</hi> [according to theſe words; <hi>I have been deſirous heretofore to have attempted ſome diſcovery of our Baths,</hi>

                  <hi>according to thoſe Principles: but being thought (by ſome) either not convenient, or not uſeful, I was willing to ſave my labour, which perhaps might have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be worth thanks.]</hi> For, what can be more neceſsary, and therefore uſeful and convenient too, than to know the Principles of any Water we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our Patients to? and what did all the Mineral
<pb facs="tcp:100351:12"/> Writers that treated of ſuch Waters before him whoſe authority he uſes, but either make ſuch enquiries, or ſpeak by gueſs? and which of theſe two is the more uſeful or convenient, is eaſily determin'd.</p>
               <p>Beſides, by this means we act as rational Phyſicians, and free the Baths and Mineral Waters from that aſperſion they labour under, of being accounted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirical Medicines, whereas they are the exact compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the beſt Phyſician, and perform their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by virtue of the Ingredients they conſiſt of, and the bleſſing of God Almighty, as all other good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and Preſcriptions do.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this way we can better judge of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the effects, which without this, perplex the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with an ignorant admiration, and we prove no better than the ordinary Spectators at a Puppet-play, who admire the motions, but know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the hand within that occaſions them.</p>
               <p>I confeſs indeed, <hi>his thinking his pains might not have deſerved thanks,</hi> might ſomewhat diſcourage him; but a man of Reſolution would have conſidered that things of this kind, ſubjected to publick view, would fall either into the hands of underſtanding, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and unbiaſt perſons; or elſe ignorant, ſelf-intereſted, and narrow Souls: the former ever have been, and will be ever ready to give what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ingenuity ſhall deſerve; and for the other, they are not much to be regarded, being beſt brought to a knowledge of themſelves by an underſtanding of their errors; and as their mouths are no ſlanders, ſo their thanks are but ſlender, if any, commendations. And thanks be to God for it, there have been and now are many worthy, brave, and generous Spirits in this our Nation, who can diſcern and make diſtinction 'twixt things that differ, elſe had would be the condition ef thoſe that have broken through that oppoſition at
<pb facs="tcp:100351:12"/> which others have boggled, and think it no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to undergo rude Cenſures from the ruder multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in proſecution of a deſign for publick advantage.</p>
               <p>Although the Credit of the Waters hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Bathing, and advanced by Drinking, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially theſe two Summers laſt paſt, yet a far greater degree of Reputation may be acquired, by a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of the more remarkable Cures that are annually wrought, principally thereby; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing digeſted into the nature of a Regiſter, would mightily conduce to the ſatisfaction of thoſe that ſeek remedy here in the like diſtempers. And although I have endeavoured what in me lay to promote ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a good work, yet ſuch is the ſtupidity of ſome to things of their own advantage, that nothing of this nature hath yet been performed, although recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the learned Doctor <hi>Jorden,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:100351:14"/> to the better diſpoſed perſons, who by their good example, and readineſs to comply in this particular, may have an efficacious influence on the more captious and excepting, to beget in them a better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this charitable, and orderly deſign.</p>
               <p>Neither can this Tax in reaſon be imagin'd to be prejudicial to the Waters, as ſome others are reported to have been; on the impoſition of which the Waters are ſaid to have loſt their virtue: for however the truth of ſuch ſtories may be admitted, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by credible Authors, and I cannot contradict, yet certain it is, that if any ſuch thing ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, it was either on the reſtraint of a publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, by denying Poor people the uſe of the Waters, or elſe by an Impoſt collected by the Officers of the Prince to his private advantage; whereas this is only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent exactions, and moral abuſes, between man and man, and the Poor rather hence to be relieved than exacted of, with a probability of a much greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort that will be procured by a reaſonable demand, and good order withal.</p>
               <p>The overplus of this Collection, if rightly manag'd, and the years prove lucky, may in a ſhort time, make a purſe for the covering one or two of the Baths alſo, whereby the Waters would be rendred uſeful all the year, which hy reaſon of the coldneſs of the ambient Air, and fear of injury thereby, and no other, are thought not ſo fit to be uſed in the Winter ſeaſon, the Waters then being as effectual as in Summer.</p>
               <p>And this would be agreeable to the uſe and cuſtom of moſt of the Baths in <hi>Europe</hi> which are cover'd, and thought by the beſt Phyſicians to be a means of keeping the Waters to an even Temper, being an equal defence againſt the wind and cold of the Winter, and the troubleſom heat of the Sun in Summer; ſo that nothing external cauſing alteration ſupervening, the
<pb facs="tcp:100351:14"/> benefit of the Waters may be ſafely received from the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> to the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> which would be much for the relief of thoſe infirm perſons that require a longer ſtay than ordinary here, and by their ſo long abſence from the Bath, do but weave <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope</hi>'s web, undoing in the Winter, what is done in Summer; whereas if they did in this manner, as we ſay, follow their blows, they probably would not only prevent a relapſe, but ſet themſelves in a way of perfect recovery with one reſolution, without many comings at ſeveral ſeaſons, being many times not ſo well at their ſecond coming, as they went away on their firſt ſeaſon of bathing.</p>
               <p>For this uſe I think the Queens Bath moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, both in regard it is but ſmall, and alſo more eſpecially for the conveniences of the Slips, and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about it, where it is almoſt no more than out of Bath, into Bed; and if well cover'd, and care taken in riſing, may be as well as if a man made uſe of a Bath in his own houſe or Chamber where he lies. After which the Croſs Bath may follow, if it be thought fit, the Kings, and Hot, being kept open ſtill.</p>
               <p>But againſt this I foreſee two Objections will be made. Firſt, <hi>That it will be inconvenient in the Summer time to ſit ſo cloſe, if no offence doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the ſteam.</hi> And, Secondly, <hi>That it will be injurious to the Lights about the Bath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt, I anſwer generally; That thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that deſire good, will think nothing an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that is in order to it, and thoſe that come for pleaſure may be ſomewhere elſe; yet that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be made out ſome other way, I ſuppoſe the increaſe of Heat, which ſometimes that Bath wants, procured by keeping the Air out, and the ſteam in great meaſure in, (which yet will not be more than
<pb facs="tcp:100351:15"/> will well be endured) will make a ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for this ſuppoſed moleſtation. And as for the Steam, a vent hole, or Tunnel at the top, will ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, that it may not be offenſive or troubleſome at all.</p>
               <p>As to the Lights, the Croſs Bath will certainly inconvenience none, and the Queens may be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, if made flat, as to do the ſame but if built more erect for gaining room below, there will be but a very little blind, or perhaps none at all, to the lower Windows on the <hi>Hart</hi> lodging ſide, which houſe, by reaſon of the accommodation of the Slip thereunto belonging, being, in all probability, likely to partake moſt of the profit, may contribute a little in this kind. But to avoid all exception, the Cover may be ſo made with ſhutters on a Timber frame, that it may be eaſily taken off if there be occaſion, and as ſoon cloſed up again, if neceſſity ſhall require.</p>
               <p>One thing more I ſhall only add, which as a means to eſtabliſh greater order and content, with ſubmiſſion to more political judgments, I here propoſe, That I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the perſons having dependance more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on the Bath, may be better paid by Salaries, than the <hi>Nunquam-ſatis-arbitrary</hi> way now on foot; That their number may be leſſen'd, being by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and (the conſequent thereof) their neceſſity, only ſuch as repine at now, and prey one upon another; and that two Serjeants, four able men to manage the Pumps, and cleanſe the Baths, four Women to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and place the Females; with twelve Chair-men, may be ſufficient. The Salaries to be paid them by the Officer in chief, collected by the Serjeant, and raiſed by a moderate demand by the Pole from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſers of the Waters, according to their conditions, quality, and time of ſtay at the Bath, expreſſed in a Table for that purpoſe mentioned before; and if any
<pb facs="tcp:100351:15"/> other clamorous demands, uncivil deportment, neglect, or want of duty, ſhould at any time happen in thoſe Servants, upon complaint made, to be animadverted on, ſuſpended, or diſcharged by the Authority under which they are. Theſe things ſome may make light of, but the Prudent will conſider.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100351:18"/> whoſe Temper the modeſt Doctour was a great ſtranger, and of whoſe behaviour he would be much aſham'd, were he now alive; who on his pretended relation hath repaid me with ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and fooliſhly threatned me with Trouble for my good will. Now to put an end to all diſputes of this kind, I have thought fit to appeal to any underſtanding perſon, that hath his ſenſes exerciſed, and his wits about him, (for all have not, and ſome have none at all) whether my Additions have been any impair to the Doctor's Reputation, whom I have treated with all the Civility imaginable; and for the Sale of the Book (a good argument of its acceptance) I believe there were not more ſold in the Doctor's life time, of what he printed himſelf, than went off the firſt year of my Impreſſion. But to ſilence all Cavils and ſilly Objections of this nature, I have diſcharged that Author, and publiſhed in this diſcourſe my own thoughts and Obſervations, and how much different they are from his, or agreeable to Truth, may beſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the ingenious Reader.</p>
                     <p>I did intend indeed, according to my Promiſe in the end of my Preface to the Edition of Dr. <hi>Jorden,</hi> to have amplified that ſmall diſcourſe into an <hi>Hiſtory of Bathe;</hi> but finding no encouragement ſince to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and many things that have made me alter my reſolution, my intentions are to wave that, and apply my ſelf, in ſome convenient time, to the <hi>Roman Court,</hi> where I ſhall have a fairer Trial, and more Juſtice done me. In the mean time, I hope this may in ſome meaſure ſtop the gap, and releaſe me of my obligation to the Candid world; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Antiquities of the Baths and City can hardly, I think, be improved higher, and the Myſtery of the Sacred Waters of <hi>Minerva,</hi> is not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100351:18"/> to be profan'd, which it wants little of if idly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to vulgar Capacities; which, beſides that they are incompetent Judges in other matters, are apt to put a ſiniſter interpretation on thoſe very things, that really are, and were ſo intended for their own advantage; neither had I publiſhed the Obſervations I now do in this language, had it not been on a more particular account.</p>
                     <p>The ill Uſages and great Indignities I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready met withal, from an ungrateful people, in the proſecution of my deſign of making further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into the Nature of thoſe Waters, are not here to be mentioned; they are ſufficiently known to be products of Envy and Malice, and as I have hitherto contemned what pitiful oppoſition could be made againſt me by the united ſtrength of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Pride, Beggery and Revenge; ſo I ſhall not ſurceaſe my Thoughts in due time of performing that which will be better eſteem'd by more Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, and render me and my deſign moſt acceptable when beſt underſtood. It was a fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of a grave Divine to a vainglorious oppoſer of his good Inclinations, <hi>Nec propter Te coepi, nec propter Te deſinam. Thou, Satan,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>haſt nothing to do with my Concerns, for thou art at neither end of my deſign; and as I did not begin to do thee a kindneſs, ſo I will continue notwithſtanding thy rage.</hi> Such unclean Spirits have no more to do with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affairs, than to interrupt the quiet of better than themſelves; and are like a troubleſom Curr on the Road, that doth little elſe, with a beſom tail and a whiffling bark, than make a man well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed look back, his horſe kick, and ſo returns.</p>
                     <p>It hath ever been the fate of New Diſcoveries to meet with Courſe entertainment at their firſt appearance; and whereas men are uſually courteous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100351:19"/> and civilly demean'd to ſtrange Perſons, they treat ſtrange Opinions and new Inventions at another rate. 'Tis the only Policy accounted to keep a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance among men, and if any one by a more than ordinary induſtry and God's bleſſing on it, hath made at any time a conqueſt in the Intellectual world, whereby 'tis thought he may get the ſtart of his Neighbours, a rotten <hi>Cabal</hi> ſhall make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and perhaps, uſe him with as much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity as a forceable Intruder on another's right; whereas the Secrets of Nature are free to all, and the Victor here enters not by Blood, and Rapine, and Tyrannical oppreſſion, but in a way both innocent in it ſelf, and advantagious to others.</p>
                     <p>When I reflect on the hard meaſure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> met withal from the pride and peeviſhneſs of ſome conceited Brethren (who eſteem nothing Currant but what bears their image and ſuperſcription, if not minted in their own brain) on his firſt demonſtration of the Circulation to the World, I cannot but conclude, if I had no other inſtance for it, That neither Ingenuity, Learning, Modeſty, nor any thing that is good and truly valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can give protection from, though a ſufficient antidote againſt, the poyſon of Envy; <hi>Envy,</hi> that ſpreading Ring-worm, that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitarian</hi> infection, that Canker of what is ſound, and Ruſt of what is bright! to be found almoſt in all places, in Town and in Country, in the Shop and in the Street, in the Tavern and in the Ale-houſe; it hovers over all, and pitches where it can, till at laſt, if it hurt not others, it preys upon it ſelf:

                        </gap>r, That whereas I conceive, when I writ my Letter of Obſervations, that <hi>Bitumen</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> were not primarily concern'd in the Body of the Waters, and therefore no way obſervable in the Contents; by freſher Experiments and Obſervations of a later date, I am inclin'd to believe, that <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> is one ingredient in the Contents of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though not proportionable in quantity to the Salts, and loſt in the bringing them to a better co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. For if two or three ounces of the Contents, which at firſt much reſemble the courſer ſort of Sugar, be put into a Crucible in order to fuſion, when the Crucible is red, and before the Salt doth run, there is the perfect colour and ſmell of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, inſomuch that it may be ſenſibly diſcerned in any part of the room, and as the Salt draws nearer the ſtate of Fuſion, the Sulphur waſts and is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; ſo that as droſs or Recrement it burns off in Calcination, and is no way concerned in the refined Salt, though one Ingredient in the Waters, and contained in their body.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall further add, that I made a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of the Salt calcin'd before fuſion, when probably the Sulphurous parts, or ſo reputed, were not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd, and obſerv'd ſo great a <hi>foetor</hi> in the <hi>Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> repreſenting Sulphur ſo effectually to my ſmell, that it preſently obtain'd the Teſtimony (if that be any thing) of that ſenſe.</p>

                           <hi>Joh. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow</hi> LL. D. &amp; Med.</note>AND here I cannot but take notice of a Novel Writer, who Magiſterially thus determines: <hi>Quod ad Nitrum &amp; Sulphur attinet, quibus Thermas Bathonienſes imbutas eſſe hactenus creditum eſt, eorum neutrum Aquis Thermarum iſtarum ſolutum eſſe arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tror: As to what concerns Nitre and Sulphur, with which the Bathes of Bathe have hitherto been thought to be impregnated, I ſuppoſe there is nothing of either of them diſſolved in the Waters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A bold aſſertion! which had it been vented and believed but 50 years ago, would have prevented much trouble in evincing the contrary; but, ſince 'tis in faſhion to be peremptory, I do aſſert, <hi>That both Nitre and Sulphur are to be found in all the Bathes of Bathe, and that diſſolved in, and mixed with, the Body of the Waters.</hi> In order to the Proof of which, I ſhall take ſome account of the forementioned Author's 15th. Chapter of his Tract of Sal-Nitre, the arguments he hath againſt it, and his opinion to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>His words therefore, as well as I can tranſlate them, are theſe:</p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">
                        <p>Among the moſt celebrated Bathes, we may juſtly reckon thoſe of <hi>Bathe,</hi> in which admirable Waters, a continual Veſtal and ſacred Fire is maintain'd, as if things of a moſt different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were interleagu'd. Before I come to the manner how theſe Bathes receive their Heat, it will not be improper if I make ſome enquiry into the Contents of theſe Waters.</p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:100351:20"/>
                        <p>It is therefore manifeſt, that the Bathes of <hi>Bathe</hi> are impregnated with a certain Salt of an acid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for if any Sal alkali, or volatil Salt purely ſalin'd, be mixed with theſe Waters, a precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will enſue, and the Waters will become tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, and of a milky nature.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, The <hi>Bathe</hi>-water powred on boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Milk, will coagulate it, as any other acid doth.</p>
                        <p>Neither doth this acid Salt ſeem to be the only Salt of the <hi>Bathe,</hi> but is complicated with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali; for if the Water be evaporated quite away, a certain Salt of a more fixt nature will be found in the bottom of the veſſel, which, on the powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any acid on it, will ferment.</p>
                        <p>Of the ſame nature alſo are the Mud and Sand of the Bathe, which are wrought up with the Springs; for any acid liquor being powred on them, an Ebullition will follow.</p>
                        <p>There may be alſo obſerved in theſe Waters a Salt, or rather a Lime-Chalk kind of Earth, ſticking to the bottom of the Gouts, or paſſages, almoſt in all places where the Water paſſeth.</p>
                        <p>From what hath been ſaid may be collected; That the Bathes of <hi>Bathe</hi> are impregnated with a certain acid ſaline Salt, and the Salt of the Bathe ſeems not much unlike Tartar vitriolated, or Aluminous Salt.</p>
                        <p>The Reaſon why theſe Salts deſtroy not one another, but each of them ferments with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Salt; may be underſtood from what hath been delivered in the former Chapter: To wit; Theſe Salts are ſo imperfect, that in Conjunction they cannot deſtroy one another. But more of theſe Salts, hereafter.</p>
                        <p>As to Nitre and Sulphur, with which the Bathes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100351:21"/> have hitherto been thought to participate, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That neither of them is diſſolv'd in thoſe Waters.</p>
                        <p>That there is no Nitre in the Waters appears by this, That the Salts that remain after the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of the Bathe-water, put on a Coal, burn not, as Nitre doth. Although I ſhall not deny, that thoſe immature Salts of an Alkali nature, (which are alſo contained in the Sand, and<note n="*" place="margin">If that be meant by <hi>Fimus</hi> in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to expreſs which, <hi>Limus</hi> or <hi>Lutum</hi> had been more proper.</note> Mud of the Bathe) being expos'd ſometime to the air, may, perhaps, by its influence be converted into Nitre.</p>
                        <p>As to Sulphur, which hath been ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be in all Bathes, 'tis not, I believe, diſſolved in theſe Waters. Becauſe,</p>
                        <p>If a Solution of Alom, Vitriol, or any other Salt, whether acid, or fixt, be mixed with the Water of the Bathe, Sulphur diſcovers not it ſelf to be precipitated, either by a fetid ſmell, or any other ſign; which notwithſtanding in the Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sulphur in the water of unſlak't Lime, or made into a Lixivium, doth appear, where the Sulphur by the affuſion of any acid Liquor is precipitated.</p>
                        <p>I am not ignorant that the Water of theſe Bathes, if Salt of Tartar, or a purely vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Salt, be caſt into it, will preſently turn white, as is declared before; which colour proceeds not from Sulphur, but a ſtony, or Aluminous matter precipitated, not much unlike to what is obſerved in the Water of unſlak't Lime, when any fixt Salt is mixed therewith; in which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not to be ſuppoſed the Sulphur is diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if Sulphur be boyled in Water of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlak't Lime, the Water becomes white, not by the affuſion of a fixt Salt, as before, but of an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100351:21"/> acid; ſo that fixt Salts may diſſolve Sulphur, but not precipitate it. Wherefore if Sulphur be contained in the Waters of the Bathe, they would be precipitated, not by a purely ſaline, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but an acid Salt, and the Sulphur ſo precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated would diſcover it ſelf by a fetid ſmell, which it doth not do.</p>
                        <p>To which I add, That an acid Salt, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Aluminous, doth ſeem to predominate in the Bathes aforeſaid, ſo that they become altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfit to diſſolve the Sulphur.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, If Common Sulphur be boyled in thoſe Waters, they are never tinged with a yellow or Sulphurous colour, neither can Sulphur, by any means, be precipitated from the decoction, as I have often experimented.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I much admire the famous <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the heat of the Blood, ſhould affirm, That Sulphur boyled in Bathe-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be diſſolved after the ſame manner, as if boyled in Water of unſlak't Lime.</p>
                        <p>Now if Sulphur ſeems to be diſſolved in the Waters aforeſaid, the occaſion of the miſtake, I ſuppoſe to be, That the decoction was made in a veſſel, in which ſome fixt Salt had been decocted, ſo that the Solution of the Sulphur may be made by ſome particle of a fixt Salt, with which the veſſel might be ſeaſon'd.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Baths of <hi>Bathe,</hi> 'Tis the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion that Silver dipped into them is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured yellow, in the ſame manner as if it were caſt into a Solution of Sulphur, and hence it is ſuppoſed that the Baths have Sulphur in them; but experience evinceth the contrary; for Silver put into the Bath-water becomes not reddiſh, or yellow, but rather black.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100351:22"/>
                        <p>The miſtake may ſeem to ariſe from this, That 'tis cuſtomary with the Bathe-Guids to tinge, and as it were guild over pieces of Silver with a Salino-Sulphurous Mud, or Dung, ſuch as is often found in houſes of Office, and put them off to Strangers, for a little profit, as if they were coloured with the Bathe-water.</p>
                        <p>And here this is to be noted, That a kind of Bituminous Mud, with a ſmall pittance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sulphur, is brought up with the Springs, which only ſwims on the top, or elſe continues at the bottom, but never is diſſolved in the Waters themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Neither is Sal Armoniack, as ſome imagine, to be found in theſe Waters; for if on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Sal Armoniack, Salt of Tartar be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the purely ſaline volatil Salt (of which Sal Armoniack in part doth conſiſt) being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from the acid Salt, to which it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united, will preſently fly off into the air, and will quickly be diſcover'd by a pungent affecting the noſtrils, which is never obſerv'd in the Bathe-waters.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly; As to Vitriol, the Croſſe and Hot Bathe ſeem to have none at all; for if Galls are beaten, and infuſed in theſe Waters, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn purple nor black; which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be, if theſe Waters had Vitriol in them.</p>
                        <p>The King's Bathe ſeems to have a little Vitriol in it; for if ſome beaten Galls are caſt into that Water, it will have a light tincture of a black purple colour.</p>
                        <p>'Tis alſo to be noted, That a certain<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Minera,</hi> for <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, uſed here</note> Mineral of a Metallick nature, ariſeth out of the Earth, with the Springs of the Bathe, which is eaſily turn'd into Vitriol. For if any acid liquor be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100351:22"/> affuſed on the Sand (which breaking out with the Springs, is found in the bottom of the Bathe) it being corroded with an acid Menſtruum, not without a remarkable efferveſcence, will in part be converted into Vitriol, juſt as it happens to the filings of Iron corroded with an acid liquor.</p>
                        <p>For if that Sand of the Bathe corroded with an acid liquor, be put into the Infuſion of Galls, the liquor acquires an atropurpureous colour. Whereas if the Infuſion of Galls be put on the Sand newly taken out of the Bathe, and not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded with an acid liquor, it will, by no means, be of a purple colour; an apparent ſign, that the Metallick Sand of the Bathe, unleſs corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an acid Menſtruum, doth not turn to Vitriol.</p>
                        <p>It is further obſervable; That the Sand of the Bathe kept ſome time, and expoſed to the open air, will of its own accord, be converted into Vitriol; for if that Sand be mixed with the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Galls, the Water will contract an atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpureous appearance.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, If it be laid on the Tongue, it hath a perfect Vitriolick taſte; and no wonder, for the Nitro-aereous Spirit, after ſome time, cloſeth with the Metallick Mineral, and Salino-Sulphureous Marchaſite, of which Vitriol uſeth to be made, mixed in the Sand, and cauſeth it to ferment, and at laſt, as was ſhewed before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it into Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> An Examination of ſome Particulars in the former Chapter.</head>
                     <p>HOW far this Author hath ploughed with my Heifer, I leave to the conſideration of thoſe that have been any way acquainted with my deſign; and ſhall only here take notice, what Obſervations are agreeable with, or different from thoſe I have often made with the greateſt exactneſs, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trials, ſubmitting all to the unbiaſt judgment of Indifferent perſons.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of all, I concur with him, that the Baths of <hi>Bathe</hi> are in part impregnated with a certain Salt of an Acid nature; but why this acid Salt ſhould be called <hi>Aluminous,</hi> I am not yet ſo fully reſolv'd, as much on other accounts, ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what on this, That although an acid Spirit be in Alom, yet the moſt perceptible taſte is either <hi>acerbe</hi> or <hi>auſtere;</hi> which being not obſerved in theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I have ſo much reaſon to judge <hi>Alom</hi> not predominant, as aſſerted here.</p>
                     <p>The Experiment he mentions of precipitation or alteration of the Waters to a milky colour, or almond Milk, we owe to the Ingenuity of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Mr. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> who, though he had not the good hap to diſcover what was precipitated, yet gives it the general name of an <hi>inſipid Magiſtery,</hi>

                     <p>If any blame me for calling it by ſo homely a name, I deſire they would conſider, that I had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100351:23"/> rather call it ſo than a Metallick Mineral, or a <hi>Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no-ſulphureous Marchaſite,</hi> ſuppoſing it more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all their apprehenſions that will be concern'd in things of this nature, and whom I would not have abuſed with hard names and uncouth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; the effect of Oſtentation, or ſanctuary of Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>That this is <hi>Freeſtone</hi> appears by this, that 'tis inſipid, gritty, ſcowrs, leaves a white colour like Chalk on the fingers after it, and is inclinable to an union into a ſtony conſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>That this is not <hi>Calx vive,</hi> or any <hi>lapis Calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> that holds affinity with it, I am much induced to believe from this,<note place="margin">See Obſ. <hi>83</hi>
                        </note> That neither the Inſipid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery, nor the more gritty powder, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different but in fineneſs and colour, will, either alone or together, open the body of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which is uſual with <hi>Calx vive,</hi> as I have fully experimented by decocting two parts of the powders with one of Sulphur in a proportionable quantity of Water, which gave the water very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle alteration, and as little was precipitated. To make it further evident, I calcin'd a large Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it with as ſtrong a fire as could well be given, yet nothing quick or limy did appear, but dead and gritty aſhes, which, mixed with water, neither made it white, nor created any diſturbance. But more of this in what will follow.</p>
                     <p>That the Bath-water will coagulate milk, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, but not as any other acid liquor doth; for this doth it ſooner upon affuſion, and makes a hard curd; that with the Bath-water, muſt boyl again and that pretty ſmartly, elſe a ſoft white Curd, as commonly it is, will not appear.</p>
                     <p>I alſo agree with the forementioned Author in this, That there is a conſiderable quantity of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100351:24"/> an<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder this Notion, I take the liberty to underſtand Common Salt, or <hi>Sal Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word: for the Salt of <hi>Kali</hi> or <hi>Glaſſewort</hi> is Marine, though uſed indifferently by the Chymiſts for the fixt Salt of any Vegetables, by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination.</note> 
                        <hi>Alkalizate</hi> Salt, mixed with ſome other Salt in the body of the waters, and apparently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable by the taſte, as well in a <hi>Lixivium</hi> made of the Contents of the waters, as in both the Courſer part, the reſult of the Evaporation, and alſo the purer part, when made white and refin'd; and that this <hi>Alkali</hi> doth conſtitute good part of the Saline matter, with which the Baths are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated.</p>
                     <p>For I am apt to believe, that great part of the acidity is breath'd off in evaporation, either in the Bath or over the fire, or both ways together, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard very little of that taſte is perceptible in the Salt extracted, but the Saline is eaſily diſcover'd. To the confirmation of which the acting alſo of acids on it may ſomewhat conduce, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of many this Summer, who according to my directions have diſſolved the Salt in the Bath-water to improve it, and have ſenſibly found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the other taſte, but little or nothing at all in acidity.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth the <hi>Lixivium,</hi> though made very ſtrong, nor the <hi>Oleum per deliquium</hi> dropt 20, 30, or 40 drops into a ſmall proportion of water, tinge with Galls either purple or black.</p>
                     <p>I may alſo urge as an Argument for the evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> the abundance of a yellow <hi>Ochre</hi> which aſcends with the ſteam of the Bath, and is there chiefly to be found where the ſteam of the Water meets with any reſiſtance, as I have noted elſewhere, which probably may be the <hi>Terra Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioli:</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100351:24"/> And although 'tis not very eaſie to give the reaſon, why the <hi>Vitriol</hi> ſhould not be as viſible as the <hi>Ochre,</hi> or elſe make it more acid than we find it to be; yet if we conceive it to be in <hi>ſucco primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo, aut Solutis principiis,</hi> and there <hi>per halitum,</hi> and ſo <hi>per tranſitum</hi> too, it may better be conceived to go off, and not imbody as the other Salts do. Yet that all the Acidity is not breathed of, will appear from this, That the Bath-water cold will coagulate Milk. And what is more, the ſame water diſtill'd from a gallon to a pint, a fourth part of that pint will make a curd, when the diſtill'd water in the Receiver will do nothing at all: Which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably proceed either from ſomething Vitrioline, or rather from the acidity of Sulphur, in regard the Salt made white, in which is nothing wanting but the Sulphur, will not coagulate, as the water doth; whereas the browner Salt before calcination, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Spring-water, will. So then, this <hi>Alkali</hi> is but one part of the fixt Salt, found in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel after evaporation <hi>ad ſiccita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a further confirmation that an <hi>Alkali</hi> is contained in the waters, which, conſidering the Quantity that may continually be made evident both to light and taſte, will ſcarcely be judged to need other demonſtration. Yet 'tis obſervable, that the Croſs-Bath having lately been kept drawn four or five daies, the Saline matter not meeting with water ſufficient for its diſſolution, was driven up in ſubſtance from the Springs, and again reverberated by the ambient air, and incruſtated on the tops of the ſtones that were above the water in the bottom of the Bath, which gave me ſome divertiſement to behold, and, on examination, appeared much <hi>alkalizate</hi> both by taſte and ignition; ſome pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100351:25"/> alſo I obſerv'd in it, which I rather judg'd to proceed from the acrimony of <hi>Nitre</hi> than <hi>Tartar,</hi> but the predominant taſte was clearly <hi>alkaliſate,</hi> which after the Nitrous parts were waſted, was leſs exceptionable in the remaining calx on the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron after burning, in which the Alkaliſate taſte was moſt remarkable; not to mention its crepitation, and that ſome pungency alſo is obſerved in an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>To make it further evident that this accretion did probably ariſe from the <hi>Minera,</hi> I believe, not far diſtant, and was not engendred or contracted from ſome floating particles in the air derived elſewhere, and there ſettling by way of Magnetiſm, as ſome may imagine; 'tis further remarkable, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtones under water, nor, what is more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, any ſtone either of the Seats, or in the ſides of the bottom of the Bath, remote from the water, had any Salt affixed to them, but only thoſe, as I may ſo term it, that peeped out of the water, the tops of which only, as I ſaid before, were incru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated. So that had a Magnetiſm any place here, the Salino-Nitrous particles muſt, I conceive, have lighted as well on the ſtones of the ſame nature hard by, as where they were, the reaſon of the thing being much the ſame. For a fuller Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this, <hi>See Obſ.</hi> 88.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge alſo this, That a great Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is produc'd by the affuſion of Acids on the Sand and Mud of the Bath, (but do not tell you who firſt obſerv'd it) and a much leſs on the Scum; yet I muſt be excus'd in this, if I ſay, That I cannot conceive how this ſhould ariſe from the action of Acids on a Saline matter, in regard it tranſcends my underſtanding to apprehend, how any Salt can poſſibly lie at the bottom of the Bath,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100351:25"/> either in the Sand or Mud, undiſſolved, and the waters no higher impregnated than we find they are.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a trivial Obſervation, that what is diſſolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in any liquor, the pores of it will receive till it can hold no more; neither can I be yet perſwaded, that there are juſt ſo many poroſities in the Bath-water aſſigned for <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and the reſt taken up with other Bodies, ſeeing the diſſolution of <hi>Vitriol</hi> in the Bath-water afterwards, and the alteration in taſte that happens thereupon, is ſufficient to give me ſatisfaction to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But to ſpeak a little more to this, becauſe the Author inſiſts ſo much upon it; If any <hi>Vitriol</hi> be contained in the Sand, 'tis no abſurdity to conceive that warm water may diſſolve it and fetch it out; now, if half a pint of warm water be poured on an ounce of Sand, with what agitation you ſhall think convenient, and thus let ſtand infuſed ten or twelve hours, the water then decanted, and the ſand dried and weighed again, there will be little wanting in the weight, abating for the <hi>Ochre,</hi> which ariſeth firſt to the top, through the body of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, much like white <hi>Vitriol,</hi> afterwards precipitates and ſettles at the bottom on the Sand, and is hardly preſerved in the decantation.</p>
                     <p>The Ebullition therefore, on the affuſion of acid liquors on the Sand, I conceive doth ariſe from ſomewhat not Saline (if Taſte be the judge) of which I ſhall treat more at large by and by: So that the Sand and Salt are no further of the ſame nature, than as fermentation may ariſe upon different Commixtures. How this may be reconcil'd to the Experiment I ſometime made, of making Ink with Bath-water and Galls, and the Sand of the Bath, with other things which might have been
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100351:26"/> no ſmall encouragement to this opinion, I ſhall have occaſion in part to declare hereafter, but more when I find my Anſwer is required.</p>
                     <p>As to the Salt, or rather, to uſe the new-made word, <hi>Calcineous</hi> kind of Earth, ſticking to the bottom of the Gouts and paſſages, almoſt in all places where the water paſſeth, I was never yet ſo happy, though I have ſearched particularly to find any ſuch thing. I confeſs I have heard it ſpoken, that five years ago, or thereabouts, there was a Gout out of order at the Croſs-Bath, in the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of which there was obſerved ſome ſuch matter adhering to the Paſſage; but this, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was as much above the Civilian's knowledge, as the Phyſicians, and whether a bare Tradition with ſome other uncertainties, to ſay no worſe, be a ſufficient foundation for this Hypotheſis; <hi>That the Salt of the Bath doth much reſemble a Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Tartar, or Aluminous Salt,</hi> I ſhall leave thoſe to determine that know the meaning of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Sentence, <hi>Nullum ſimile eſt idem.</hi> And ſeeing that the Author chooſes to call this adherent matter by the name of a <hi>Chalky kind of ſubſtance</hi> rather than a <hi>Salt,</hi> I think I may not be much miſtaken if I imagine it to be <hi>Freeſtone;</hi> concerning which I can ſay no more, till I ſhall happily meet with the like accretion.</p>
                     <p>That the Fermentation on the affuſion of Acids on the Sand, ariſeth chiefly from the acting of that liquor on <hi>Freeſtone</hi> in conjunction with ſome Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaceous particles, and not from any other Saline matter, ſeems evident from this; That whereas theſe parts with a blew Clay or Marle, Rubrica, Ochre, and Chryſtal-pebbles, are clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable by a Magnifying-glaſs in the Sand, when the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100351:26"/> between the Sand and it, is amicably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, the remaining particles of Sand that will not ferment, are only ſome part of the Marle and Chryſtals; And this I call <hi>Arena caſtrata,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by this means, the Sand loſes its fermenting vigour, though the ſtones do remain.</p>
                     <p>And whereas the Mud of the Bath, which ſeems chiefly to conſiſt of this blew Clay or Marle, with ſomething Sulphurous, will do the like; the Fermentation I conceive doth ariſe not ſo much, though ſomething I confeſs, from the Earth it ſelf, as the Teſtaceous particles with which it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, in which Earth nothing Saline can be diſcovered to which the ebullition may make any pretence.</p>
                     <p>To this may be added; That the colour of the Acid liquor, after Saturation by the Sand, is altogether the ſame with what ariſeth from the <hi>Freeſtone,</hi> both equally reſembling the infuſion of the filings of Steel; ſo that in this alſo there is an agreement.</p>

                     <p>THat <hi>Nitre</hi> is contained in the Body of the Waters is evident from this, that it may, by art, be extracted thence; and I may as well ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and, if I pleaſe, believe, that I had not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in my pocket, when I took out ſome ſilver for a neceſſary uſe; as when I ſee <hi>Nitre</hi> taken out of the Bath, ſay it was never there.</p>
                     <p>But the difficulty will be to prove the thing; now, I ſay, a <hi>Sceptick</hi> may doubt whether a Man be a Man, a Brute a Brute, or whether he makes uſe of his voice that asks the Queſtion; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be not the wiſer man that takes theſe for granted, and not pragmatically contradicts the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous conſent of Judicious Writers, is eaſie to determine.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs it burns not as Common <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> doth, becauſe it leaves a Calx behind it; but in that more reſembles the <hi>Nitre</hi> of the Ancients, a pound of which being burnt will leave four ounces of Aſhes:<note place="margin">Jord. <hi>Nat. Bath. &amp; Min. Wat.</hi> chap. 7. p. 53.</note> 
                        <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> will leave none.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth it huff, nor melt altogether in a ſmall quantity as <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> doth, on the account of an allay it receives from the mixture of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salt of an <hi>Alkaliſate</hi> taſte with ſome bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs withal, which remains on the Iron-plate after accenſion, and is little more than a fourth part of the Body; wherefore to deny the being of <hi>Nitre</hi> in the Salt, becauſe 'tis not all ſo, is as abſurd, to make a Linſey-woolſey Compariſon, as to affirm, there is no Woollen in that ſort of Veſture where
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100351:27"/> Linnen is; or to ſay, That a man that is both Lawyer and Phyſician, hath nothing of Phyſick, becauſe he hath ſomething of Law.</p>
                     <p>But that <hi>Nitre</hi> is there, though not predominant, ſeems clear by the ſhooting in <hi>ſtiria's,</hi> which is concluded to be the proper form of that Salt; and although <hi>Tartar,</hi> and perhaps ſome other Salts, may ſomewhat reſemble it; yet the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is eaſily perceptible by the ſight, but more by the taſte.</p>
                     <p>And now I am diſcourſing of this matter, I conceive the Author did not hit the mark, becauſe he did not make the Bath-water ſhoot, in that he only mentions, <hi>the Salts that remain after evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which,</hi> he ſays, <hi>put on a Coal, burn not as Nitre doth.</hi> But the ſhootings ſo called, in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure ſomewhat pyramidal, with many <hi>Columellae,</hi> or ſmall pillars cloſely united, put on a red-hot Iron-plate, and ſo burnt, may alter the caſe, which I affirm to do, as I mention'd before.</p>
                     <p>And, what is not a little conſiderable, on the burning of ſix ounces of the Chryſtals, in order to the Examination of the remaining Calx, the Nitrous parts of the ſhoots, being many in number, in a ſhort time melted, and ran down both ſides of the Iron-plate in a ſtream, conſonant to <hi>Pliny</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Nitre,</hi>

                     <p>To which I may add the bitter Taſte apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcoverable in the Salt, inſomuch as to bring it within the verge of a ſuſpicious appearance of a <hi>Sal amarum</hi> (if any ſuch Salt there be diſtinct from <hi>Nitre</hi>) which bitterneſs hath been accounted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>Nitre,</hi> and the waters impregnated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Alſo for a further ſatisfaction, if any Aluminous parts were contained in the Chryſtal ſhoots, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, That the ſix ounces mentioned before, after they had hufft, melted and ran upon the Iron-plate, were in little more than one minute reduced to ſomewhat leſs than two ounces of a dead white <hi>Calx;</hi> which being again diſſolved, filtred and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporated, gave me a plain <hi>Alkali</hi> with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining bitterneſs, which on the affuſion of any acid would ferment, and being put to undergo the <hi>fire-ordeal</hi> Trial, would neither melt nor boyl, but crackle and leap.</p>
                     <p>To make a further Trial, whether what was bitter and ſuſpiciouſly Nitrous might be ſeparated from the <hi>Alkali;</hi> I diſſolved and filtred the ſame Salt again, and evaporating it <hi>ad Cuticulam,</hi> it ſhot pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And here I would not be miſtaken, as if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to that grand <hi>Arcanum,</hi> the diſcovery of the Nitre of the Ancients, for I am well aſſured, that the deſcription of that is very much different from what I am now diſcourſing of, being acknowledged by <hi>Pliny, Dioſcorides,</hi> and others, to be of a roſie colour, and almoſt purple, which they uſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to dye that colour with (though ſome white there was alſo) and came nearer to the nature of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Salt, whereupon <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> in his 85th. Chapter hath theſe words, <hi>Nitre, and the froth of Nitre</hi> (or <hi>Aphronitrum) have the ſame virtues as Salt, and are burn't like that;</hi> yet becauſe ſome meaſures may be taken from that, for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of what is now under the teſt, I thought fit in that regard at preſent, only to make this bare mention of it.</p>
                     <p>Neither can the contrary, I think, be evinced from the effects; for cooling, penetrating, and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are attributed to Nitre, and confeſſedly in the waters, the two former evident in allaying thirſt, abating inflammations, and quickneſs of paſſage: the latter, as plain in its operation, for Nitre as well as Salt, is ſaid both <hi>alvum laxare,</hi> and <hi>urinas ciere,</hi> and <hi>Baccius</hi> treating of nitrous waters, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that they do <hi>vacuare, virtute Nitri, per al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, &amp; per urinas.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the external effects by Bathing, which can no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the being of Nitre there.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, This way of arguing from the effects is but <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> and leſs ſignificant where there is matter of fact, which may be uſeful in the dark; but if it thwart with a plain experiment, muſt yield; for, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum videam facta?</hi> And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100351:29"/> whoever ſhall undertake a buſineſs of this nature may conſider, that the beſt judgment to be made of the effects, is from a conſtant obſervation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars on the place, which cannot be conceived to be ſo well done at a diſtance, but muſt require, beſides ſome time, a good attendance, as well as practice here. But to return.</p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>Stiriae,</hi> or Needles, I obſerved in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the Baths, yet in a different ſhape and conſiſtence; for the King's Bath-water after a full imbibition of the Salt diſſolved, and a ſtrong Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium thence procured, evaporated <hi>ad Cuticulam,</hi> and ſet in a cool place, ſhot from the inſide of the evaporating Glaſs into its Cavity, into ſtrong, and compacted Needles, with that ſtrength, that it took ſome of the Common Salt with it, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Nitrous ſhoots, ſomething like the ſtars in a clear sky, but white, and in a Cubical form, in perfect ſquares, or Teſſera's diſtinct from the body of the Nitrous ſhoots, with which the Nitre was ſtudded, being impacted into it.</p>
                     <p>The Croſs Bath ſhot in ſmaller Needles, but long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and very thin, in great number, directly from the bottom of the glaſs, very cloſe together, but diſtinct each from other, much like the Finnow, or hairy excreſcence, that oftentimes ariſeth from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted matter, which on the leaſt violence offer'd would break, and not endure any kind of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>The Hot Bath gave me more trouble to bring it to ſhoot, inſomuch as being fruſtrated in two or three Experiments, I had almoſt concluded there was nothing Nitrous there, but the thing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſucceeding, I had on a ſmall quantity of the Salt diſſolved, and the Lixivium evaporated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art, five, or ſix ſingle Stiria's, bigger,

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Sulphur in the Bath water.</head>
                     <p>AS to Sulphur, the next thing to be inſiſted on, as contained in the Waters, I conceive that many that have endeavoured to avoid <hi>Charybdis,</hi> have fallen into <hi>Scylla,</hi> and becauſe the ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have aſſerted that Sulphur was undoubtedly concern'd in all Baths, they will affirm there is none in any; but whoever builds a fabrick on this foundation, and certainly concludes, that Sulphur is not in the Bath-waters, becauſe it cannot be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by precipitation, I would have forbear a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive determination on a negative experiment, till I ſee Vitriol precipitated in ſubſtance from the King's Bath-water, which is acknowledg'd to be there. And if I cannot light on an apt precipitater, which every way oppoſeth the particles to be ſo diſcover'd, and have ſome other reaſons to incline me to the contrary, I ſhould not be ſo fond of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100351:31"/> as to be prevail'd upon by a comparative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of unſlak't Lime, to wipe my own Noſe, and put out my Eyes, which as far as they can, aſſure me to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall refer the Reader to what is mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning the Colour and Smell, in calcining the Contents of the Bath-water in general, and till I ſhall meet with ſomething that will both burn blew, and give a fetid ſmell, that is not Sulphur, I ſhall ſo eſteem that, till aſcertain'd of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                     <p>I may further add, That the Sulphur is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly incorporated with the Salt, as appears by its paſſing with it into the Lixivium, and through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in filtration, and not diſcoverable but by a ſtrong fire, by which the body of the Salt is open'd, and a ſolution of the Continuum made, in order to fuſion; ſo that if you do not precipitate both, you can precipitate neither, unleſs a ſeparation of the Sulphur from the Salt be made, which, I preſume, is not eaſie to be done, without the help of fire, by which the Sulphur is conſum'd: ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative inſtance of unſlak't Lime is little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; where the Sulphur is ſeparated, decocted, and precipitated; here not ſo, being not apart, but reſiding in a Saline-Sulphureous Salt, a piece of whoſe Body, as we now have it, it ſeems to be.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Whereas he collects from the Bath-waters not ringing Silver yellow, but rather black, that there is no Sulphur contained in the ſame; I may retort, and that very juſtly, this as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to aſſert it. For the proper colour that Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur diſſolved gives to Silver is not ſo much yellow as black, as may be e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſily diſcerned by putting any piece of Silver, but a very little while, into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100351:32"/> of Sulphur made in the water of unſlak't Lime, which gives as near the colour of the Silver I have cauſed to lye ſome time near the Springs of the Bath, as may be, ſo that the difference is not diſcernable; not to mention that ſome yellowneſs is obſerved on the Silver tinged by the Bath.</p>
                     <p>Neither am I fully ſatisfied that the only, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the beſt, precipitator of Sulphur is an acid; for on the decoction of that Mineral in the water of quick Lime (the Lixivium, though with much Sulphur, not ſucceeding) and very ſudden change, on the affuſion of Spirit of Vitriol, into a milky, and much whiter Conſiſtence, the Liquor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſettled, and precipitated not as Sulphur, but Lime-ſtone; ſo that the Sulphur, although it gave a greater fetid ſmell, yet was not ſo apparently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated, as by Oyl of Tartar in another glaſs, which gave the Sulphur in proper colour precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without a permanent lacteous opacity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I made this obſervation, as to the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, That although acids do not precipitate of this lapideous matter alone, yet if in the embraces a ſtrong ſulphurous commixture, they will, and the Lime-ſtone is moſt properly precipitated by an acid, if Sulphur be decocted with it; whereas the Body of Sulphur, decocted as before, is beſt precipitated by a fixt Salt, the Sulphur appearing without white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in its own garb, though not ſo fetid as on the affuſion of an acid.</p>
                     <p>It may be alſo noted that <hi>S. Cloſſeus,</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of <hi>Lac Sulphuris,</hi> in which the body of Sulphur is open'd with <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> directs the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur to be precipitated with Urine.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of this miſtake (ſeeing he pretends to give the reaſon of another, concerning an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of a like nature) I conceive to be, That
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100351:32"/> the white matter precipitated on the affuſion of any acid, was, without much examination, reputed wholly ſulphurous, as appears from theſe words; <hi>For if Sulphur be boyled in the water of unſlak't Lime, the water becomes white, not by the affuſion of a fixt Salt, as before, but of an acid: ſo that fixt Salts may diſſolve Sulphur but not precipitate it.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the whiteneſs ariſeth much from the mixture of the Lime-ſtone, as appears by the open confeſſion of what is precipitated, if ſtanding ſome time, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and brought to the teſt by fire, where the Lime-ſtone is diſcover'd, the Sulphur being rather diſturb'd than precipitated by the acid liquor, which makes it give a greater fetor, but never kindly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates; the other precipitation with oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which here, contrary to its wonted courſe, joyns with the Lime-ſtone, which it uſually preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates, and oppoſeth the Sulphur, is very apparent, and ſulphurous beyond contradiction.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant, that in the preparation of <hi>Lac Sulphuris</hi> mentioned before, Sulphur alſo is precipitated by an acid, but <hi>that fixt Salts ſhould diſſolve Sulphur, but not precipitate it,</hi> is what I ſaid I was not ſo fully ſatisfied in. Not to mention that the matter precipitated by a fixt Salt is white on the firſt affuſion, though the whiteneſs be not ſo permanent, the Sulphur in a ſhort time precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in proper colour.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, If Sulphur be boyled in the Bath-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and doth not tinge it with a yellow colour, I preſume, it cannot thence be argu'd that there is no Brimſtone there, for the colour of the water in which Sulphur is diſſolved, is not ſo much yellow as Lixiviate, or reddiſh; and therefore <hi>Schroder</hi> gives this direction for the making that preparation of Sulphur mentioned before, that after the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100351:33"/> and Tartar are mixed, they ought to boyl, <hi>donec fere omne Sulphur ſolutum ſit, liquor<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>

                           </expan> rubeus appareat;</hi> though ſome addition I confeſs it may have from the Tartar. Yet <hi>Cloſſeus,</hi> in his way of making that preparation where there is no Salt of Tartar, but, inſtead of that quick-Lime, which gives no ſuch tincture of it ſelf, hath this Note; <hi>Coque, donec partes tres aquae ſint conſumptae, ruborem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que contraxerit inſtar ſanguinis, ex Sulphure diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I therefore think it no ill advice here, that they that are ſo much concern'd to give the reaſon of the miſtakes of others, would a little mind to rectifie their own, and not be an <hi>Argus</hi> abroad, but a Mole at home.</p>
                     <p>I do alſo acknowledg, that I believe that the white Magiſtery or in-palpable Powder, precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Bath-water on the affuſion of Salt of Tartar, or any other analogous, or agreeable Salt, is not Sulphurous, much leſs Aluminous; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stony, of a lapideous ſubſtance, the reſult of an intimate Commixture, with the body of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which may have no ſmall influence on their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as may hereafter be more fully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
                     <p>And as to what reflects on that famous Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Ingenious and Learned Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> I ſhall, at preſent, ſay no more than this, That ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving one ſo pedantickly dreſt up in his own clothes, he ought not to be affrighted with his own ſhape; only this may be further noted, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> had deſired of me the exacter trial of that Experiment of decocting Sulphur and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony in the Bath-water, I well remember I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd him ſomething of both that was precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after a double filtration, and the decoction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100351:33"/> in a Veſſel altogether free from the ſeaſon of any fixt Salt.</p>
                     <p>Yet I muſt acknowledg, that what was precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated was very inconſiderable to what was decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not ſo much as to make much alteration in the colour of the water; which may deſerve their conſideration wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> affirm, a Lime-Chalk Stone, or <hi>Lapis calcarius,</hi> to be contained in the Waters, and yet deny them to diſſolve Sulphur, and again affirm, that Sulphur is diſſolved in the water of Lime.</p>
                     <p>The ſame alteration of the water into a turbid milky appearance, and the precipitation by oyl of Tartar, of an inſipid powder, mentioned before, was alſo obſerved in the Spaw at <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and Sulphur-Well at <hi>Knaresbrough,</hi> by <hi>William Simpſon</hi> Doctor in Phyſick, as appears from ſeveral places in his <hi>Hydrologia Chymica,</hi> and Hydrological Eſſays, which he there aſſerts to be Aluminous, and page 118. of the latter Treatiſe ſaith; <hi>By the addition of Oyl of Tartar this Sulphur-water turns white, and that becauſe it is impregnated with a ſmall quantity of a Simple natural Alom Salt.</hi> How far Alom is concerned in that water, I ſhall not here diſpute, but leave it to the Learned Dr. <hi>Wittie,</hi> whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it is: only thus much I can ſay, that the like <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> appearing in theſe waters, what is thus precipitated here is not Aluminous, as hath been acknowledged by many eminent Phyſitians, who have ſeen ſome quantity of the precipitated powder; and was particularly noted by the ever Honoured Sir <hi>Charles Scarbrough,</hi> this Summer, here.</p>
                     <p>But to prevent any miſ-underſtanding, I muſt acknowledg that this aſſertion ſtands on this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the white powder precipitated by oyl of Tartar from the Waters, is the ſame with the finer
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100351:34"/> ſort of what I had, in greater quantities precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpontaneouſly <hi>per decubitum,</hi> on the evaporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many Hogſheads of the Water, and is now to be ſeen, though not altogether ſo white nor fine, having undergone many alterations, which being decocted in Spring-water, the water filter'd will precipitate with oyl of Tartar, as the Bath-water doth; yet if any one ſhall think fit to deem this Saline, and perhaps, Aluminous; he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how any Salt can ſo ſoon be deveſted of the eſſential property of what is ſaline, as to be rendred perfectly inſipid, when ſaline at firſt: though I do not abſolutely deny, but that we may attribute, though ſomewhat Catachreſtically, the name of Salt, to ſomething not ſaline, communicating with it in ſome other of its properties.</p>
                     <p>I know very well that Alom diſſolved in Spring-water, the Water filter'd and the Salt precipitated with oyl of Tartar, will be impaired much in its ſaline taſte; yet ſo much of the ſowrneſs, and ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity will remain, as will be ſufficient to diſcover its nature.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Vitriol in the Bath-water.</head>
                     <p>TO paſs by the Reaſon of the Common Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of tinging Silver at the Bath, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Scum, and Sal Armoniack, as of no great moment; Vitriol is, by Him, denied to be in the Croſs and Hot Bath, becauſe Galls beaten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in theſe Waters, will never turn them purple nor black, which is confeſſed would certainly be, if theſe Waters had Vitriol in them.</p>
                     <p>How true this is, a ſlight Experiment will ſoon evince, and if the Author had ever made trial, his Galls or Sight, muſt be worſe than mine, if a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour did not appear.</p>
                     <p>To which may be added the Experience and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my Honoured and Learned Friends Sir <hi>Edward Greaves,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Nat. Highmore,</hi> who have both made trial, and found the Waters turn. With the former of whom I lately further obſerv'd, that when we had been ſufficiently ſatisfied in the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colour of the Hot Bath Pump-water, with leſs than half a pint of Water and but two grains of Galls, and had thrown away the Water and Galls, in order to the trial of ſomething elſe, more of the ſame Water, though much cooler than when brought at firſt, being powred into the ſame glaſs, turn'd colour alſo, receiving a brisk light purple, from the remaining particles of the former infuſion about the glaſs, though nothing of the Galls did appear at all.</p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100351:35"/>
                     <p>'Tis alſo confirm'd by this, That whereas the Leaves of Oak make little or no alteration in the Water of the King's Bath, the Chips, or inner Bark of the ſame make rather a better purple in the Water of all the Baths, than the Galls; only the King's Bath tingeth deeper than the other two, as in all Experiments of this nature, it appears to do. The like alſo will happen on the Seeds of Sumach contus'd and infus'd, but with Pomegranate Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers moſt apparently, ſo that the Water of any of the Baths affuſed hot on that, will preſently turn purple; though the colour doth not keep ſo long in ſtrength, as that which ariſeth from the Oaken Chips.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſider'd, I conceive it no injury to the King's Bath to allow it a little Vitriol, though manifeſtly derogatory to the other two to deny it, ſince they make their claim by the ſame evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and that Judg will hardly free himſelf from the cenſure of injuſtice and partiality, that will not hear a poor mans Tale, but ſuffers an honeſt Cauſe that hath weak lungs and a weaker purſe to be loſt, on the louder clamours of more importunate addreſſes.</p>
                     <p>The truth of this Experiment being thus far call'd in queſtion, I am the more afraid of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſome others; for I remember an old Story of Mr. <hi>Thief</hi> in the Univerſity, that was wont to be very buſie in ſome Bookſellers Shops, and entred in the Shop-Book under that name, whoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was taken in the fact but one time, was oblig'd to quit the whole ſcore, on this account, That he that was really convicted once, might commit the ſame thing five, ten, or twenty times before, and therefore he the man from whom all was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100351:35"/>
                     <p>The Metallick Mineral, ſo called, hath nothing Metallick contained in it; and if this be ſo eaſily, by the air, converted into Vitriol, 'tis very ſtrange we have not yet had any Houſes of Vitriol, which ſurely have endur'd the air long enough to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a Tranſmutation.</p>
                     <p>As for the Sand breaking out with the Springs in which Vitriol is ſuppoſed to lye undiſſolv'd, as was mentioned before, if there were no better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for Vitriol than this, I ſhall not ſtick to ſay, that he that depends on this, builds at beſt but on a ſandy foundation.</p>
                     <p>That the purple colour appearing from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sand of the Bath, with the infuſion of Galls, may not ariſe from the tincture of Vitriol, ſeems more than probable by this Experiment. I have formerly declared, that the Sand of the Bath may be ſo far corroded with an acid Menſtruum, as not to ferment any longer, but lye quiet in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the glaſs without any motion at all; now, this Sand on the affuſion of Common Water gave an excellent purple, when 'tis not likely that any thing ſaline ſhould remain, after ſo many waſhings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affuſions, as are requiſite to reduce the Sand to that condition. Moreover 'tis conſiderable, the infuſion was not acid, nor any way alter'd from its common taſt. But this Experiment I made but once, and had not an opportunity of repeating it again.</p>
                     <p>'Tis likewiſe more obſervable, That after ſome hours ſtanding, a purple floccous matter did ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly precipitate, upon which there being a clear ſeparation, the Water return'd to its priſtine colour, and the floccous matter ſubſided in the bottom of the glaſs, which being filter'd <hi>per Chartam,</hi> and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, was perfectly inſipid, and not at all Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:100351:36"/>
                     <p>Beſides, On the Calcination of half a pound of the Sand, when the Crucible was as red and the Sand as hot as uſually it is when the Salts do run, the Sand powred out glowing hot, nothing ſaline was obſerv'd to concrete among it, which it would certainly do, if any fuſible Salt were there, as in other Calcinations it appears to do.</p>
                     <p>I therefore rather judg it to proceed from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid but aſtringent Ochre, ſuch as is mentioned by <hi>Fallopius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De Met. &amp; Foſſ. c. <hi>35.</hi> de Ochra.</note> which lying ſome time in the open air, becomes more ſowr than when taken out of the Bath, which may occaſion the difference between the Sand newly taken, and that which is kept ſome time; the Ochre it ſelf infus'd making the liquor much blacker after ſome ſtanding, as is more fully declared in the following Chapter.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="7" type="chapter">

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Containing a farther Proof and Illuſtration of the former particulars.</head>
                     <p>TO make this a little clearer; 'Tis an eaſie Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment to powr warm water on the Sand, in what proportion you pleaſe, which if kept ſome time will alter the water in which it is infus'd, into a yellowiſh or amber colour: when the water is impregnated very well, mix ſome of this with the infuſion of Galls, and preſently an atropurpureous colour will appear, in which if you infuſe white paper but a very little while, you will quickly be ſatisfied what colour it will tinge. Now, if this infuſion be permitted to cool, the Ochre will preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate, leaving the water ſomewhat yellower than in it ſelf it is, to which it alſo communicates a harſh taſt, and at laſt ſettles on the top of the Sand, from which it may be ſeparated by decantation. The contrary happens to the Sand newly taken, in which the Ochre clogg'd with too much moiſture cannot ſhew it ſelf, as when older, and more dry. So that I ſee no reaſon or neceſſity, from this <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> to aſſert the exiſtence of Vitriol in the Sand of the Bath, otherwiſe than as it hath relation to this aſtringent Ochre, which I do believe receives this tinging property by the impreſſion of Vitriol, this being in all probability, as is noted elſewhere, the <hi>Terra Vitrioli,</hi> or Earth, in which the Vitriol is contain'd before exhalation; as I conceive, the Marl or Mud is the bed of Sulphur, or the <hi>Terra,</hi> to which that Mineral doth more nearly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100351:37"/>
                     <p>And that 'tis this yellow matter that occaſions the alteration, may be further evident from this; That after the firſt decanting, if the Ochre be powred all off, and warm water affuſed on the Sand again, and that infuſion mixed with the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Galls, no change of colour will enſue. To which may be added, that the Ochre it ſelf kept ſome time, and infuſed in the decoction of Galls, will, after lying a pretty while, turn that Liquor into a much blacker appearance.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall end this diſpute with the obſervation of one,<note place="margin">D. <hi>Simpſon</hi>
                        </note> who affirms, That Artificial Alom will not with Galls ſtrike a purple colour, but the Natural Alom with its inbred Ochre, will; aſcribing more to the Ochre than the Alom. So that this may be the end of that Controverſie about Alom and Galls tinging Water purple, That Alom, as Alom, doth not tinge, but as in conjunction with this inbred Ochre, or as Vitrioline; for between Vitriol and Alom there are many reſemblances, and a worthy Author hath obſerved,<note place="margin">Jord. <hi>Nat. Bath.</hi> chap. 7. p. 52.</note> that the Baſis of Vitriol is Alom, both theſe being much alike, but that Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol hath a garb from Copper or Iron, which in the Ochre gives the tinging quality, the Alom, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from Vitriol, contributing nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall affirm this Ochre to be Vitrioline, I have not deny'd it, having formerly ſuppoſed it might be <hi>Terra Vitrioli;</hi> but what I here queſtion is, whether any Vitrioline ſaline body, different from the Ochre, be contained in the Sand, or can lye undiſſolved there.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very remarkable what is ſaid, That if the Sand of the Bath, impregnated with an acid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, be put into the infuſion of Galls, the Liquor acquires an atropurpureous colour; and no wonder, ſince the acid Liquor may do much alone, as may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100351:37"/> be ſeen in the mixture of Vinegar, with the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or infuſion of Galls, which ſupplying in ſome meaſure the place of Vitriol, by a kind of analogy inclines the infuſion to an inky complexion.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Metallick Mineral contained in the Sand, which on the affuſion and corroſion of an acid Menſtruum, will in part be converted into Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, I have ſaid before that 'tis nothing elſe but a Common Freeſtone, a Mineral, I confeſs, but how far Metallick, I leave to the judgment of the men of that Art.</p>
                     <p>For a partial ſatisfaction in this thing; if the ſharpeſt Vinegar be powred on the Sand in one glaſs, and on Freeſtone in another, the ſame fermentation will appear for the preſent, and the ſame blewiſh colour of the infuſion afterwards upon Corroſion; ſo that it much reſembles the colour and ſmell of the ſaturated Liquor, on the affuſion of Vinegar on the filings of Iron. But whether this be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument to dub it Metallick, I ſhall be better ſatisfied, when I am convinced of this, That Truth hath never ſuffer'd by meer Reſemblances.</p>
                     <p>But that it may appear that I deſire to proceed in this Affair with all ingenuity and freedom from animoſity, unleſs what will ſeem neceſſary to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truth; I ſhall here recite a Paſſage out of Dr. <hi>Wittie</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>Hydrologia Chymica,</hi> leaving how far it may be applicable to the ſaline Stiria's mentioned before, to the judicious Reader and further obſervation.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100351:38"/> much from the factitious or natural kinds of Alom, Vitriol, or Nitre, though in ſome properties it agree with each of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Reaſon of this Scruple, he adds, is this, which</hi> Paracelſus <hi>hath clearly made out, That here they are not corporally, but</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">I ſuppoſe, the Doctor doth not mean, that what is percolated hath no body or ſubſtance, but only that 'tis more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd.</note> 
                        <hi>percolated, not perfect in their ſeveral kinds, but</hi> in ſuo primitivo, <hi>not ſingle, but all mixed together, which as yet I could never attain to ſeparate. And therefore this Salt is nothing ſo acid as Vitriol, nor ſtiptick as Alom, nor inflammable as Nitre, notwithſtanding it doth ſhoot in Stiria's. I'le only add this, That they are all here, though</hi> in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis, imminutis, &amp; debilitatis viribus, <hi>and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Waters to be judged from them all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I ſhall only ſubjoyn this Remarque, That the Nitre, undoubtedly here, being allay'd with the mixture of ſome other Salts, could not be expected to do altogether as ſincere Nitre doth, and the beſt way, I conceive, to diſcover the diſtinct natures in this <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> had been to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a ſeparation by frequent Calcinations, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and Coagulations, which, if done, I much admire the ſeveral Salts did not appear in proper form, as they did in the anomalous Salt of theſe Waters, ſubjected to the ſame way of trial: and then I ſomewhat queſtion, whether Alom would have deſerved ſo much favour, as the Doctor's good nature hath allow'd it here.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall forbear, at preſent, to trace this Author or follow his track any further, as alſo to examine his Opinion, concerning the Cauſe of the Heat of the Bath-waters, till my Treatiſe, in the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he hath written in, be preſented to the World; only thus much I ſhall ſay now, That I conceive an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> founded, though not on a ſubterranean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100351:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> give more ſatisfaction than ſome airy notions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering eſpecially, that nothing external to the Body of the Earth, can in reaſon be ſuppoſed capable of reaching theſe Waters, but rather ſomewhat inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in its own Bowels, which may be near at hand, of an active, even, and durable nature; when, to ſay no more, nothing is more variable than the air, nor unconſtant than rain.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall alſo diſtinguiſh the whole bulk of what relates to the Body of the Waters, into things Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and <hi>non</hi>-Saline: the former I ſhall endeavour to evince to be <hi>Nitre, Common Salt,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol;</hi> the latter, to be partly unctuous, as <hi>Bitumen</hi> and <hi>Sulphur;</hi> partly gritty, as <hi>Freeſtone;</hi> and partly earthy, as <hi>Marl</hi> and <hi>Ochre.</hi> I ſhall likewiſe exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what pretences Alom can make, and further diſcourſe of the difference between that and Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol: and laſtly, enquire into the competition of <hi>Lapis Calcarius</hi> with Freeſtone; ſo that the Bath-water will have relation to, or comprehend in its largeſt extent, eight diſtinct Subſtances, at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Obſervations, which will be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, God willing, of the firſt Book of my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>De Thermis Bathonienſibus,</hi> viz. <hi>de Aquarum Principiis, una cum earundem appendiculis, nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Arena, ſive Sabulo, Luto, &amp; ſupernatante uligine, ſive Spumâ.</hi> The ſecond Book ſhall treat <hi>De Aquarum Calore.</hi> The third <hi>De uſu Thermarum; ubi de modo Balneandi; de Aquarum potatione; de Antliatione jam in uſu loco dulciae, aut Stillicidii Veterum; de uſu Luti,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <p>It hath been indeed the ill fortune of theſe Baths, (which I may truly ſay are as good if not better than any Baths in the world) to lie a long time in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not ſo much as to be mentioned among the Baths of <hi>Europe</hi> by any forreign Writer, till about the Year 1570. when that Excellent Perſon Sir <hi>Edward Carne,</hi> ſent Ambaſſadour by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, made ſome Relation of them to that famous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Andreas Baccius,</hi> then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and writing his elaborate Book <hi>de Thermis,</hi> into which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted them, upon his Relation, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.

And although that Learned and Candid Phyſician had <hi>chiefly and more eſpecially an intent to enlarge the Knowledg of our Baths in</hi> Somerſet-ſhire, (as he declares to my Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> in his Dedicatory Epiſtle) and hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed more than any Man before him, yet what was firſt in Intention, was laſt in Execution; and how ſmall a part of that Treatiſe is ſpent upon this Subject, how ſhort he is in ſome Material Points, and what Objections may be framed againſt his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I may ſometime or other, with due Reſpect, more largely treat of; and for the preſent ſhall here, with good <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> caſt a Garment over the Nakedneſs of this my Father.</p>

                           <p>And here at firſt I cannot but take notice how that opinion hath ſo much prevailed as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Orthodox, and not only received by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as certain, but Printed as ſuch, that the Body of the Waters is ſo jejune and empty, as to afford little or nothing at all whereby to make a diſcovery of its Nature, and that what impregnates the Baths is not Subſtantially, Materially or Corporally there, but potentially, virtually and formally, or to uſe the Author's own words, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </note> with much more canting after this manner, in a ſmall diſcourſe in Latin written by an Itinerant Exotick; when as a ſlight operation will ſoon evince it, though white and tranſparent of it ſelf, being taken imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Pump, to contain a conſiderable quantity of a Dusky, Gritty, and Saline Matter, with many tranſparent Particles intermixed with it, to the proportion, (as near as I can calculate) of two drams to a gallon of the Water. And this I can aſcertain, having had ſeveral ounces of it done in Earth, Iron, Bell-metal, and Glaſs, and have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100351:41"/> at this time three or four ounces by me, untoucht, beſide what I have made uſe of in other Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                           <p>But the thing I ſhall more Peculiarly inſiſt on, at this preſent, is, That by God's bleſſing on my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Search, I ſuppoſe I have lighted on the main Conſtituent of the Virtues of the Bath, in which chiefly reſides what benefit can be expected from the uſe of theſe Waters, and lodgeth in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſubſtance, in a very ſmall proportion to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Waters; ſo that as they are now, not much more than forty grains is contained in a Gallon, inſomuch that this little Soul, as I may ſo term it, is almoſt loſt in ſo Gigantick a Body, and cannot animate it with that vigour and activity as may be rationally expected, were a greater quantity of the Salt contained in a leſs proportion of the Water. The Remainder, which is not Saline, being, as I judg, two Parts of Three of the Bulk of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, is partly Whitiſh, Gritty, and of a Lapide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature, concreting of it ſelf, into a ſtony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence not eaſily diſſolvable; partly more Light, and Dirty, reſembling Clay, or Marle, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf by an apparent ſeparation from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Gritty part mentioned before.</p>
                           <p>Now the chief Virtue of the Bath, as I conceive, conſiſting in the Salts, which appear by undeniable Experiments, to be Nitrous, and I believe Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line (Bitumen and Sulphur being not Primarily, as theſe Salts, but Secondarily concern'd) and no ſmall proportion of other things blended with it, the beſt way to make it moſt ſerviceable I conceived to be, to free it from thoſe incumbrances and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays it hath from the other Ingredients, and prepare it as exactly as may be performed by Art, for the benefit of thoſe eſpecially who are willing to Drink
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100351:41"/> the Waters with greater ſucceſs in a leſſer quantity; which they may now do, and have more of the virtue of the Waters in a quart, three pints, or a pottle, than they formerly had in two or three Gallons, did they drink ſo much; which will be, beſides other Conveniencies, a great relief to the Stomach, which certainly muſt be relaxed, and the Tone of it injured by that vaſt quantity of Water which is uſually taken, diluting its ferment over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, and diſtending its Membranes beyond all the bounds of a reaſonable Capacity.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, What is ſeparated only by an artificial Extraction will better unite again, and mix with the Waters, as much more familiar, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Salts of <hi>Sal Prunella,</hi> Cream of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are uſually diſſolved and drunk with the Waters; ſo that a great part of the Operation may be aſcribed to that; and the Waters being, as we ſay, between two Stools, that of it ſelf, and the diſſolvent in it, hath not attained to that degree of Reputation as they have deſerved, and may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured with much more advantage, if nothing but the ſame be ſpent upon the ſame, a way of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment altogether equally beneficial to Fluids and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, to the wet as to the dry.</p>
                           <p>Again, Whereas it is a cuſtom here as in all other places of the like Nature, when Perſons are not willing, or have not conveniences to come to the Fountain Head, to ſend for the Waters to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Reſidence, not thinking it much material whether <hi>Mahomet</hi> go to the Mountain, or the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain come to him, whereby the Virtue of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is much impaired, if not ſtopped and ſealed up with very great care; this defect may in good part be ſupplyed by the addition of a Quantity of the ſame Ingredients, which may repair the loſs that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100351:42"/> hath been ſuſtained by Evaporation in the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or other way of damage, and reſtore it again, as near as may be, to its priſtine Virtue, and genuine advantage. Not to mention, that if need require, and the poorer ſort cannot procure or pay the Fraight for the Waters, they may take a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er courſe, by mixing the Salt, which they may have at reaſonable Rates, with Spring-Water, brought to a proportionable degree of heat at home, and expect more advantage, for ought I know, than thoſe that drink the Waters themſelves at ſo great a diſtance.</p>
                           <p>And becauſe I am now fallen on this Subject, I ſhall crave leave to remind you of what you well enough underſtand already, that not only <hi>Dulcius</hi> but <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilius ex ipſo Fonte, &amp;c.</hi> and Waters eſpecially impregnated with volatile Spirits, ſuch as moſt acid are, and peculiarly Vitrioline, to avoid the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and expence, not ſo much of Money as Virtue, in the Carriage, muſt be drank on the place where they are, which, in ſome kind reſembling Children, that muſt live by ſucking, if once remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their Mother, or Nurſe, by degrees dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle away, and at laſt die.</p>
                           <p>It is obſervable in theſe Waters, that with four Grains of Galls injected into a Pint Glaſs of Water, or the Water poured on it, it immediately turns of a purple Colour, which in ſhort time after, as the Water cools, abates much of its vividity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more faint: if the Waters be ſuffered to cool, and be quite cold before the Galls are injected, but little alteration happens upon a much greater proportion of Galls ſuperadded, and (what is more remarkable) if the Water, which is permitted to cool, be recruited by the Fire, and the ſame Tryal reiterated, it offers no greater ſatisfaction in change
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100351:42"/> of Colour, than the ſecond Experiment. Conſonant to what <hi>Andreas Baccius</hi> hath formerly obſerv'd, who in his ſecond Book <hi>de Thermis, Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Pag.</hi> 69. hath theſe words, <hi>Nulla Balnei Aqua, eodem cum ſucceſſu ac laude bibitur longe exportata, quo ad fontem proprium; maxima enim parte ex ipſo fonte hauſtae ac delatae, amittunt omnem virtutem; multae non ſervantur per hyemem, dilutae pluviis; &amp; quae ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ſervantur delatae à propriis fonticulis, fieri non poteſt, quin amittant, cum calore ſuo Minerali, vivificos illos Spiritus in quibus omnis Juvamenti vis conſiſtit, quae ſemel amiſſa, nullo poſtea extrinſeco calore reſtituitur. Quod eſt valde notandum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I have been the more particular in this, in regard it is a very uſeful and practical Diſcovery, and may procure more real advantage to Mankind, than the vain and unattainable attempts of the Philoſophers Stone, making Glaſs malleable, and the Quadrature of a Circle.</p>
                           <p>Some other Obſervations I ſhall alſo mention, of a leſs magnitude, and more contracted circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as the dying of the Bath-guides skins, the Bathers Linnen, and the Stones in the bottom of the Bath, of a yellow colour, and the eating out of the Iron Rings of the Bath, the Iron Bars of the Windows about the Bath, and any Iron infuſed in it; inſomuch as I have now by me a Gad of Iron by accident taken up among the Stones of the Kings-Bath, ſo much eaten out, and digeſted by the Oſtrich ſtomach of theſe Waters, that, the ſweetneſs extracted, what remains reſembles very much a Hony-comb, a deep perforation in many places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attempted, and the whole Gad it ſelf reduced to a thing very much like a Sponge.</p>
                           <p>The firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tincture I have diſcovered to ariſe from an Ochre, with which the Bath abounds,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100351:43"/> and hath afforded me a conſiderable quantity, ſo that now I have near a pound by me, and with an infuſion of that in warm water, tinge Stones as exactly of the Bath colour, that they are not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one from another. It is further obſervable, that the nearer the place of ebullition, where the Springs ariſe, the deeper and finer is the Yellow colour, ſo that in ſome places, about the Croſs in the Kings Bath, and at the head of the great Spring, at the Southweſt corner thereof, it is almoſt made a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paint, being laboured together by the working of the Springs, and a continual ſucceſſion of new Matter coming on, free from thoſe impurities it contracts in other places, which make it diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able into two or three ſorts, according to its mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with, or freedom from, more adulterating Matter. The Clouts alſo and Woollen Rags, which the Guides uſe to ſtop the Gouts withal, beſides the Walls, Slip-doors and Poſts, when the Bath is kept in a conſiderable time, as in the Winter ſeaſon it uſeth to be, are all very much tinged with this yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubſtance, and if at any time they chance to lie unwaſh'd or not thrown away, they ſend out ſo ungrateful a ſcent, that a man had rather ſmell to a Carnation, Roſe, Violet, or a Pomander, than be within the wind of ſo unwelcom a ſmell, it being the greateſt policy to get the Weather-gage in this encounter. The ſame thing I have experienced in Veſſels at home, where after it had ſtood ſome time in a common infuſion of warm water, I have the ſame reverence for that as Pictures, and do aver it to be true, <hi>E Longinquo reverentia major.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>One thing more is to be noted before I leave this particular, that although ſo much of this yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Matter is continually bred, with which the neighbouring Ground is ſufficiently repleniſht, as I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100351:43"/> have found by digging in ſome places not far diſtant, yet nothing of that colour is diſcovered in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, a probable argument it either evaporates, to which I am more inclin'd, in regard I find it much more copious where the Steam of the Bath meets with any reſiſtence, or elſe it may be, which is leſs probable, turns colour by the fire in evaporation that way; leſs probable, I ſay, becauſe for further ſatisfaction, I have decocted the Ochre more than once, and find rather that it gets than loſes in its colour.</p>
                           <p>The Reaſon of this I conceive to be, That this Ochre being probably, as I have elſewhere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſt, the vehicle of Vitriol, on its ſeparation from it in the open air, precipitates to the bottom, and tinges the ſtones with a yellow colour, leaving the body of the waters through which it paſſes much unconcern'd; which may be one reaſon, why the Water of the open Bath tingeth not with Galls, as I have obſerv'd, like that from the Pumps, though the avolation of Spirits may not perhaps be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ridiculous, conſidering eſpecially, that the water from the Pump when cold, will loſe its ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property, though nothing be obſerv'd to be precipitated. And that ſome of this yellow matter is contained in the water, though with ſome difficulty obſerved, doth appear from the fifty ſecond Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                           <p>The greeniſh colour ariſeth from another cauſe, which I conceive may be the effect either of the Salt or Vitriol, or both, the former making that colour in meats long in ſalt, and the latter, if from green Copperas, may eaſily be underſtood.</p>
                           <p>The eating out of the Iron I conceive muſt proceed from ſomething Corroſive, and till any one can aſſure me 'tis ſomething elſe, I ſhall judge
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100351:44"/> it to be Vitriol, though the Salt alſo may contribute not a little. And that it may appear not to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the bare ſteam, as Ruſt is bred upon Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks and Cotterels, beſides the difficulty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the ſteam ſhould operate under water, as in the caſe of the Gad before mentioned, I made a Lixivium of the contents of the Water, and in it infuſed Iron but a very ſmall time, and found it to do the ſame as in the Bath it ſelf, conſidering the time of infuſion; and the very Knives and Spatules I put in to ſtir ſome reſidence in the bottom, were almoſt as ſoon as dry, cruſted over and defended with a ruſty coat.</p>
                           <p>I have other Arguments I ſuppoſe will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething more to the confirmation of this opinion; as that with the help of the Sand of the Bath, with Water and Galls, I made good writing Ink, which in a ſhort time comes to be very legible; but the infuſion of the Contents in Common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Lixivium thereof, with an addition of an inconſiderable proportion of the decoction of Galls makes it tolerably legible on the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture, only the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that made with Sand, caſting an eye of decayed red from a mixture of Ochre contained in the ſame. Neither is it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be ſlighted, that the Water it ſelf hath been heretofore uſed by the beſt writing Maſters for the making of Ink, who obſerving by their experience, that Ink made with Bath-water, and the other u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Ingredients, had a better colour, and was more laſting than any other, preferred this Water before any other for this uſe, as I have been informed by ſome credible perſons. Alſo having not long ſince occaſion to pour warm water on the Contents of the Bath, in order to the making a Lixivium, ſome of the water happened by an accident to fall on a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100351:44"/> Bazil skin I ſometimes uſe, and immediately turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Red into a Black more than the breadth of an ordinary hand, with as much facility as any Curriers Liquor. Alum I know will do the like, but I find no neceſſity to aſſert that, which had it any thing to do here, muſt make the Water much rougher, whiter and ſowrer, than I find it to be. To which I may add, that many judicious perſons, my Patients, and ſome intelligent and eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians alſo have aſſured me, that they have perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned by the taſte a mixture of Vitriol, and that I need not doubt, but that was one principal Ingredient. 'Tis alſo not very inconſiderable, that the Bath-water alone will coagulate Milk, though not after the uſual way of making a Poſſet; for after the Milk and Water are put together, it muſt boil pretty ſmartly, elſe the Curd will not riſe. I may likewiſe ſubjoyn as a further probability, that on the relenting of the Salt extracted into an Oyl <hi>per deliquium,</hi> there is a very ſharp Stiptick and Vitrioline taſte perceived in the groſs <hi>deliquium,</hi> as alſo in the clear Oyl, and the Salt it ſelf; not to mention its ſhooting into glebes, of which I have ſome ſmall aſſurances by trials I have made, not yet ſufficiently ſatisfactory, and therefore I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs this part for the preſent, with the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, till a further inquiry ſhall make me po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.</p>
                           <p>But as to Nitre, there can be no queſtion made about that I ſuppoſe; for beſides the quick, acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, cooling, and nauſeous taſte, moſt apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcoverable both in the infuſed contents, the Salt and Oyl (the latter of which, <hi>viz.</hi> the nauſeous Taſte, I take more particular notice o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                           </p>
                           <p>I the rather mention this, in regard it hath been my good hap to bring this thing to perfection and autoptical Demonſtration, which hath been in vain attempted by ſome induſtrious perſons; not that I am, in the leaſt, willing to arrogate to my ſelf, or derogate from them, more than what is fitting, but to confirm this truth, that there are ſome <hi>Mollia tempora fandi;</hi> ſome opportunities, when Nature will give willing audience, without much ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or ado, confeſſing more by fair perſwaſions, than racks and torments, and greater importunity. And that we ought to be very cautious how we affirm a thing not to be, upon the failure of a ſingle, or ſome repeated Experiments.</p>
                           <p>In fine, Leſt I ſhould too much exceed the bounds of a Letter, what concerns the cauſe of the Heat of the Waters, I ſay little of here, only tell you, that when I ſhall come to diſcourſe of that Subject, of which I intend, God willing, a large Diſquiſition in another Language, I believe I ſhall find my ſelf obliged not ſo much to depend on a ſubterranean Fire, as to expect greater ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from another Hypotheſis.</p>
                           <p>Many more Experiments I have made upon the Sand, Scum and Mud of the Bath, with ſome Obſervations drawn from the <hi>Natura Loci,</hi> or Ground hereabouts; but, I fear, I have been too tedious already, and therefore, without further

                     <p>As to the City, it is not, I think, to be doubted, but that the Baths were before that, and gave name to it, ſick people making ſmall Cottages firſt for their Conveniences, which were afterwards improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into fairer Buildings. <hi>Conſtat Latinum nomen huic Civitati ab Antiquis inditum, Aquae Calidae ex his Balneis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Andr.

                     <p>That <hi>Edgar</hi> was Crowned at <hi>Bathe</hi> above 700 years ago, <hi>Bathe</hi> being then called an <hi>Old Borough,</hi> with great Solemnity, on <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> appears from theſe words of the <hi>Saxon Chronicle,</hi> written by one that then lived, and writ his Hiſtory but three years after his Coronation. <hi>Anno</hi> 973. May 11. <hi>being</hi> Whitſunday, Edgar <hi>was Conſecrated King with great glory, in that</hi> Old Borough Ake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manneſceaſtre, <hi>which by another name they call</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, <hi>there was great joy to all men on that Bleſſed Day, which they call</hi> Pentecoſt; <hi>there was a great Aſſembly of Prieſts and Monks, and the Wiſe met there in Councel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Edgar</hi> had lived 29 years full of trouble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, when this came to paſs, and in his 30th. year was Conſecrated.</p>

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 520. or 71 years after their arrival here out of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Saxons</hi> beſieged this City, with whom K. <hi>Arthur</hi> fought a great Battel on <hi>Mons Badonicus,</hi> now called <hi>Banneſdown,</hi> and

The <hi>Saxons</hi> then had beſieged <hi>Bathe,</hi> K. <hi>Arthur</hi> rais'd their Siege, and after beſieged them on <hi>Mons Badonicus,</hi>

To his Maſter, becauſe the <hi>Olive</hi> being the Emblem or Hieroglyphick of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> ſeemed to him to allude to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who was worthily counted the wiſeſt and moſt peaceable King in all Europe of that age. To himſelf (for the wiſeſt will flatter themſelves ſometimes) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not only a chief Counſellour to this King, and had been his Ambaſſadour to conclude a moſt Honourable Peace with <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, who paid, as <hi>Holinſhead</hi> writeth, 745 Duckets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a yearly Tribute of 25000 Crowns, but alſo he carried both the <hi>Olive</hi> and <hi>King</hi> in his Name; and therefore thought he was ſpecially deſigned for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100351:65"/> this Church-work, to the advancement of which, he had an extraordinary inclination. Thus though (as St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi> well noteth) all Dreams, be they never ſo ſenſible, will be found to halt in ſome part of their coherence: yet moſt certain it is, for the time, he was ſo tranſported with his Dream, that he preſently ſet in hand with this Church, and at the Weſt end thereof he cauſed a Repreſentation to be graved of this Viſion of the Trinity, the Angels and the Ladder; and on the North ſide the Olive and Crown, with certain <hi>French</hi> words (which I could not read) but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> is this verſe taken out of the book of <hi>Judges,</hi> chap. 9.

                        <p>Thus far that Learned Knight, and Great Well-wiſher to this Church; where it may be noted, that the Olive and Crown are on both ſides of the Church, North and South, with an Elephant on each ſide of the Olive crown'd; and the words Sr. <hi>John</hi> ſaies he could not read, are not French, but Latin, being the old Tranſlation of the Engliſh writ on both Pillars, of either ſide, in good Text hand, though now not ſo legible, above the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in this manner:

                     </head>
                     <p>COncerning the Nature, Uſe and Virtues of the Baths, I purpoſe, if God permit, to write a large and particular Account, in a Juſt Treatiſe on that Subject, conſonant to my own Principles, which for the greater Credit of this Nation and Place (nothing having ever been before attempted in this kind) ſhall be in the general Language; the deſign of which I have expreſſed <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. For I well remember what I writ in my Appendix, ſeven years ago, in theſe words: <hi>I come now to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nature, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Virtues of the Baths. And here it cannot be expected I ſhould ſay much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Experience of them as yet hath been but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and the Obſervations I have made ſeem fitter, as they are intended, for a foundation to a greater Work, which Time and Variety of Experiments muſt compleat, than at preſent to be Communicated to the Publick. And to make ſome compenſation for my Brevity in this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100351:66"/> Thing, which is juſtly deemed the moſt material of all other, I ſhall take the boldneſs to engage, as ſoon as Time and Opportunity ſhall permit, to make a through ſearch into the Cauſe of the Heat, Nature, and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Operations of the Baths, and perhaps give a more ſatisfactory Account of the former, than hath yet been given by any; and for the latter, I ſhall not build on the Hay and Stubble of the Talk and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of perſons byaſt and concern'd, but on the ſolid baſis of Reaſon, Obſervation, and Experience.</hi> And again, the laſt words: <hi>But I hope I may be excuſed on the ſcore of my former Engagement, if I am not more particular at this time in things of this nature, till a juſt amaſsment of Obſervations and Experiments, and a rational deduction of Concluſions from them, which I hope in ſome time to accompliſh, ſhall either confirm me in the opinion I now have of the Nature and Virtues of the Baths of</hi> Bathe, <hi>or ſupply me with a better.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having, I ſay, intended a Piece of this nature, and alſo publiſhed many Particulars relating to this Affair, in the enſuing Century of Obſervations, which I now make publick, as a Specimen of my way of procedure, and ground-work or foundation of my next Superſtructure, I ſhall content my ſelf at preſent with ſome few Remarks.</p>
                     <p>The Baths then in ſome Things do agree; in others are different.</p>
                     <p>They agree in this, That though chiefly three in number, the King's, Croſs, and Hot (the Queen's being but an Appendent to the King's, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's to the Hot) yet they all participate of the ſame Minerals, only the Hot Bath, if ſome of my Obſervations hold, hath ſomething more than the King's, or Croſs, both which as to the particulars, and particular proportions, in a Hogſhead, Gallon,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100351:67"/> and Pint, are much the ſame, and what is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in one Ingredient in one Bath, is made up by another, in the other. So that herein the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contrivance of the Almighty hath appeared, in making ſo fine a Compoſition of ſuch various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and acted (with Reverence be it ſpoken) not only the Phyſician, but the Apothecary too, a good example and precedent for his Creatures to follow, who have liv'd to ſee that unhappy day, wherein a blear-ey'd <hi>Leah</hi> hath been advanc'd, though with ſhame and deſtruction too, above a legitimate <hi>Rachel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They differ chiefly in Dimenſion, and degree of Heat.</p>
                     <p>In Dimenſion; The King's Bath being 57 foot, or 19 yards, 10 inches, long; 40 foot, 8 inches, or 13 yards ½ and 2 inches in breadth.</p>
                     <p>The Queen's, 8 yards, or 24 foot, 2 inches, in breadth; in length 25 foot, 4 inches; or 8 yards, 16 inches.</p>
                     <p>The Croſs Bath, 24 foot; or 8 yards, 6 inches long; 19 foot 11 inches, or 6 yards ½ and 5 inches over Northward; 12 foot, or 4 yards, 7 inches over on the South.</p>
                     <p>The Hot Bath, 10 yards 8 inches ½ long; 4 yards 13 inches ½ broad South; 4 yards ½ and 5 inches over North.</p>
                     <p>From this undeniably is deduc'd that they differ in the Water they contain; for being of different dimenſions, the greater muſt hold more, and the leſſer leſs. To purſue this Curioſity a little further, I find by Gage, The King's Bath being 1 yard 18 inches in Water, to contain three hundred and fourteen Tun, thirty ſix Gallons.</p>
                     <p>The Queen's, eighty one Tun, three Hogſheads, and eleven Gallons.</p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:100351:67"/>
                     <p>The Croſs, fifty three Tun, and forty ſeven Gallons.</p>
                     <p>The Hot, fifty four Tun, and twenty ſeven Gallons.</p>
                     <p>As to the difference ariſing from the degree of Heat, though I muſt acknowledg my defect of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in that kind, which I will hereafter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, yet I may ſay thus much now, That the King's and Hot Baths are not more different in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular than the Queen's, and Croſs, and that this latter is the moſt temperate of all.</p>
                     <p>And here it may be noted, That what is written concerning the difference in degree of Heat in the Baths, is ſo to be underſtood as eſteemed now; for the Hot Bath was formerly accounted the Hotteſt of all, whence it had its name, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the reſt being ever, and ſo reputed Hot, though in ſome degrees inferior to that. Hence <hi>Jones</hi> ſays, From what he there deliver'd, the reaſon may be gather'd why ſome of the Waters of Baths break out moſt Hot, as the Hot Bath at <hi>Bathe;</hi> others meanly Hot, as the Croſs Bath; others between both, as the King's Bath. And in another place; The King's Bath is Hot between both the other. But of this I intend, God willing, to make further Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſe of this Variation I conceive to be not an Intention, and Remiſſion of a Subterranean Fire, (which meeting with an Enemy that hath had ſo many recruits and reinforcements as the Water hath, and will have till the end of all Things, 'tis much ſhould yet keep its ground, and not be extinct, to mention no other Abſurdities at preſent, that unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably follow on that <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> this Variation, I conceive, doth not ariſe on that ſcore) but rather is cauſed by a greater or leſſer fermentation, ariſing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100351:68"/> from the Acting of an Acid on an Alcalizate Salt, both which are contained in the Bath, and much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the vaſt Quantity of an impalpable Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the greateſt Ingredient in the Waters, and ſeems to ſerve for no other end, except, what ſhall be hereafter mentioned, to adminiſter a perpetual ſupply to the Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>'Tis likewiſe obſervable, That where the greateſt Heat is, as in the King's, and Hot Bath, there is the greateſt Quantity of this fermentative matter, inſomuch as I have Calculated that near 50 pound weight goes off in little more than 24 hours in the King's; but in the Croſs Bath, where leſs need is, there is leſs of this gritty matter, and much leſs goes off in a longer time. So that having ſometime reſembled this Fermentation to Generation, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it being an acid ſaline Spirit, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this gritty matter and Alcalizate Salt, the Conjunction made, and the Thing produc'd, the father ſlips away inviſibly in a Miſt of Steam, and the mother paſſes out at a back-door as ſoon as may be, reſigning the Work to be ſucceſſively promoted in the ſame manner, to future generations. And indeed ſhould the matter ſtill continue that hath done its work, the Springs and Channels would be quickly obſtructed, ſo that what is acid being of light burden, and more active, quickly exhales, and the more Corpulent paſſeth off by convenient Sluces and Draughts, as an Excrement, upon which the Wheel of Fermentation is kept continually going, by an immediate ſucceſſion of new matter of the ſame kind. That not only the acid part, but the more fixt Salts alſo do in part exhale, may be found confirmed by the 88th. Obſervation, which cannot but part with ſomething of their Subſtance in the <hi>Lucta</hi> of Fermentation.</p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:100351:68"/>
                     <p>Again, In ſome places where the fermentation is leſs, as in the Water of St. <hi>Vincents Rock</hi> near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which hath not half the heat that the Croſs-Bath hath, the Water abates near the proportion in the quantity of Ingredients; and although for the moſt part the ſame, yet in ſo ſmall a proportion, cannot act as a greater quantity would do, and the acidity being ſo little as ſcarce to coagulate Milk, or turn with Galls, may not be expected to do wonders in a fermentation.</p>
                     <p>To conceive a continuation of the Hot waters of <hi>Bathe</hi> to that of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> by way of Drein, as ſome Ingenious perſons have imagin'd, is unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical. For if very Salt water becomes inſipid by running but the tenth part of that courſe under ground, how can it rationally be expected that any Salt ſhould be left of that little in the Bath here, after ſuch a tedious journey, in which it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily meet with many freſh Subterranean paſſengers in croſs roads, that may intrude upon it, and, by mixing with it rob it long before both of its Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Heat.</p>
                     <p>I muſt therefore ſay here, what I ſhall further diſcourſe of more at large in another place, That ſince my firſt conſideration of this matter, I was ever inclin'd to believe, that the cauſe of the Heat and impregnation of the Baths was not far off from the Baths themſelves, <hi>(Coram adeſt quod quaerimus)</hi> for to me it ſeems not a little ſtrange, that on dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſo many Wells, Stone-quarries, Cole-pits, and other penetrations of the Earth to a conſiderable depth, that have been made about the City, no Hot water ſhould appear, but only in one Stone-quarry near <hi>Dunkerton</hi> about an hundred years ago,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bathes Aid,</hi> lib. 2. fol. 20.</note> mentioned by <hi>Jones</hi> to have been ſo hot, that they were fain to forbear working: The truth of which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100351:69"/> Relation I ſomewhat queſtion, and rather believe the honeſt <hi>Cambrobritan,</hi> being a Stranger here, might the eaſier be impoſed on by ſome fabulous Relator.</p>
                     <p>Another Argument for a different Fermentation I take to be the different forms of ſhooting of the Nitrous ſtiria's; otherwiſe, why ſhould the Kings and Hot-Bath, that have the ſtrongeſt heat, ſhoot into more compact needles, and much thicker than the Croſs? but that the ſtronger fermentation ripens, and invigorates better the Crude matter of the ſhoots, when the other not ſo ſtrong leaves the matter crude and weak.</p>
                     <p>Before I give a rough Draught of my own Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, which I only here propoſe, and ſhall further, God willing, illuſtrate and poliſh in my next undertaking, I muſt premiſe theſe few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which in part contain a Survey of this Country.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the ground on which the City of <hi>Bathe</hi> in good part ſtands, eſpecially near the Baths, is raiſed ground, and that probably, under ſome yards of Gravel is a Bog, made by the confluence of Waters hither. This ſeems in good meaſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from this, That on the digging ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations not long ſince, the Workmen came at laſt to a ſoft Mud, which yielding much, and a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Pike of a good length thruſt into it, no bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was diſcovered, but a warm, Marly, Sulphurous mud adhering to the Pike. This was obſerv'd in the North and South-weſt parts of the Town.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Springs of Cold water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this place are very numerous, inſomuch that ſometime ſince, having been deſired by that Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and Learned Knight Sr. <hi>Anthony Morgan,</hi> ſince
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100351:69"/> dead in <hi>France,</hi> to ſearch what Springs I could find hereabouts, in order to the making ſeveral mixtures, if that way we might give any light to a Fermentation; I remember I brought Water from twenty two ſeveral Springs, and might have done from as many more, within two miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, on one ſide.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the two Water-houſes ſupplying the City, are placed on two Hills, one on the North, and another on the South, for the more convenient ſupply of the whole with Water.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the Bowels of the Earth on the South of the Town, with the South-eaſt and South-weſt parts, for four or five miles compaſs, are ſufficiently repleniſht with great plenty of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which ſupplies the Country round about with good Materials for building, and would do many Counties more were there a way agreed upon for its better conveyance.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That on the North part of the Town little or none of this Freeſtone is digged, but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ariſes in abundance, and on the Hills about <hi>Marſhfield</hi> ſome Marcaſites have been found, of which Vitriol is made, and probably more of that kind are contained in that ground. I mean not the white Marcaſite found on <hi>Lanſdown:</hi> what that was is notoriouſly known.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That another ſort of Earth that abounds about <hi>Bathe,</hi> is blew Marle and Ochre. This is diſcovered almoſt in all ſides of deep hollow ways, the River ſides, and particularly at <hi>Lambridge,</hi> a mile off, is a blew Marly ſlate with Ochre ſticking to it, and under that clear Ochre alone. And</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That almoſt all things about the Bath, as Marle, Ochre, Freeſtone, Sand, Mud, Scum, Shells and Salts, will ferment on the affuſion of any acid.</p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:100351:70"/>
                     <p>Theſe things premiſed, I proceed to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture concerning the Riſe, Continuation and Heat of the Baths; and man can do no more; for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the beſt Propheſie is but a good Gueſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conceive then, that the Salts and Marle with the conflux of Waters into this compaſs of lower ground, being created in the beginning, and then placed under or near where the Baths now ſtand, by the virtue of thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>multiply,</hi> have increaſed ever ſince from their own ſeeds, in their proper Seminaries, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Creation doth and ever will, till the conſummation of all things. Neither do I ſee much more reaſon to admire the breeding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of thoſe Minerals under ground, than the perpetual ſpringing and inexhauſtible growth of the little ſpires of Graſs we tread on above it: But it ever was and will be the humor of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind to overlook what's before them, and pay their admiration to what they do not ſee, it faring with many other things as with Vertue in the Poet:
<q>
                           <l>— <hi>Praeſentem odimus</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>Vertue remov'd we dote on; preſent ſlight:</l>
                           <l>And darkneſs thus prefer before the light.</l>
                        </q> The Salts being here ſufficiently fixt, two large Currents of Water may come down upon them, and meet very near or under the Baths themſelves; the one from the South, bringing with it its <hi>Cargo</hi> of Freeſtone, the commodity, as was ſaid of that part of the Country; the other from the North, acuated by ſome Vitrioline Marcaſites, over which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100351:70"/> it may paſs, and meeting near the place with all this matter that is fermentative, a fermentation may ariſe ſufficiently productive of what heat we find; conſidering eſpecially the cloſeneſs of the Caverns of the Earth in which it is bred, where little air can abate it, but rather by that advantage, reduplicate the heat.</p>
                     <p>Much to this purpoſe are the words of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and Learned Phyſician Dr. <hi>Sherley,</hi> whoſe Philoſophical Eſſay came late to my hands, and ſome conſiderable time after I had framed, and in theſe words written, my own Hypotheſis; yet in regard ſome coincidencies, though at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and without any converſe, have happen'd, which may confirm and illuſtrate what is before diſcourſed, I ſhall, by his permiſſion, crave leave to ſay, That if the words I now recite be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Bath-waters, as he intended them of Water in general, the duration and equality of theſe Waters will be better underſtood, and found to be according as I have before aſſerted. He therefore ſaith in the beginning of the eighth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Philoſophical Eſſay, p. 112. <hi>In the beginning God infuſed into the boſom of the Waters the Seeds of all thoſe things that were afterwards to be made out of the Waters, ſetting them their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant rules and laws of acting, and by the power of the words,</hi> Increaſe <hi>and</hi> Multiply, <hi>they had a faculty given them to continue themſelves in the ſame order till the World ſhall be deſtroyed by fire; at which time all Seminal beings ſhall deſert their groſs bodies, and return to their firſt fountain and grand Exemplar, GOD, on whom they have at this time a conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I am apt to believe might be made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, if digging about the Baths might be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100351:71"/> admitted and practic'd without prejudice to the Springs, which, 'tis feared, will enſue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt be content with that kind of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, which Art will afford in imitation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſome of which I could now propoſe; but I will not prevent my ſelf in things of this nature, and therefore ſhall end this Subject for the preſent with theſe two Remarks:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the Baths having the ſame Minerals, and but little differing in proportion neither, muſt be equally advantagious in the ſame diſtempers, but with this difference, that the different degrees of Heat altering ſomewhat the caſe, judgment muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe what Bath the Patient ſhall be committed to; how long it may be convenient to ſtay, and what government is to be uſed more in one Bath than another, beſides the determination of the Diſtemper 'tis proper to relieve.</p>
                     <p>And, Secondly, Whereas great diſcourſe hath ariſen here concerning the conveyance of ſome Nuts that were obſerved in the Ciſtern over the main Spring of the Kings Bath, upon the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a firm ſtone croſs in the middle, to that pretty Wooden device that now ſtands there; ſome whereof were black and rotten, others freſh with their kernels in them, and ſome with ſhales very green about them: the way of paſſage may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have been by the currents of Cold water from an open Spring, if not the River, near a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice or Wood-ſide, with which the water of the Bath may in part be ſupply'd, the Bath being, as I ſuppoſe, the great Exchequer, into which the leſſer Rivulets do return their tribute, and to which they pay their homage, as to their Liege Lord and Soveraign, conſtituted ſuch by Him, by whom Kings reign, and from whom alone they receive their Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100351:71"/> That theſe Nuts could not come, by a nearer cut, from the Bath-ſide, is moſt evident from this, That the Ciſtern was ſo well plaiſter'd about with Plaiſter of equal hardneſs with a ſtone, that it coſt very many blows to get it up; preſently from the riſe of which the Nuts did appear, immediately ſhot up from the Springs themſelves.</p>
                     <p>As to the Internal uſe of the Waters, ſo much of late applauded, and not without cauſe;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Tr. of</hi> Bathe, p. 12.</note> as a grave Phyſician, ſometime of this Place, hath in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings condemned that, the Reaſon of which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood; ſo would not I on the contrary, give my Vote for that which I had not throughly examin'd, and on good grounds judged and found advantagious.</p>
                     <p>It being therefore clear, that Vitrioline, Nitrous, and Saline ſprings, are recommended by the moſt Intelligent Writers to be uſed as a drink; and the forementioned Salts, the two latter fixt and viſible to the eye, the former more inviſible, tranſient and halituous, being contained in the Waters, I may conclude them by good conſequence to be potable and moſt proper to be drank. Neither is the heat offenſive, but amicable to the ſtomach, and doth not of it ſelf, unleſs ingurgitation procure it, incline to Vomit. But becauſe the drinking of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hath ſo much obtain'd, I have the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly diſcours'd of that in the two following Chapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It may then be ſaid; That the Bath-Water, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to preſent diſcoveries, containing thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients that may be prejudicial to the Body, the uſe of them in potion may not ſeem to be ſafe, and the beſt way to decry the internal uſe, is to Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize their body, and declare their Contents; ſome of which being gritty, and of a Lapideous nature, may obſtruct the meſentery, milky veins, and other paſſages, and conduce much to the heaping up a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous matter in the Body, and thereby give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the intolerable excruciations of the Stone and Gout, beſides the foundation it may lay for other diſtempers; others being of a relaxing and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating nature, may have no good effect and influence upon the Nervous parts, eſpecially the Stomach and

                        <p>To this, I think the Subſtance of all that can be objected, I return this Anſwer;</p>
                        <p>That the ſuppoſed Culpable parts in and about the Contents of the Bath-water, being only three, Grit, Bitumen and Sulphur, the former, though in the greateſt proportion, is ſo finely wrought and intimately mixed with the Body of the Waters, that in truth it cannot deſerve that name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I call it ſo in relation to the more brown and gritty, appearing on Evaporation,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Obſ.</hi> 83.</note> as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where obſerv'd; this then in the Waters that are drank being ſoft and impalpabable, and no magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry more finely pulveriz'd, muſt paſs in Conjunction with the Water through all its Meanders; neither is the ſtay uſually ſo long in the Body, as to occaſion any fear of a Separation, which probably may be if they paſs not well, and therein chiefly, I ſuppoſe, to lye the danger, the natural heat being not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but of a more moderate and even tenour, and too weak to make an analyſis of the Water in ſo ſhort a time, or diſſolve its body, as the fire doth, but having diſcharged its office, is diſcharged alſo by the uſual ways of Evacuation, if the Water ſtay not in the Body too long.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, The benefit of this Inſipid magiſtery may not be a little; for if the acrimony of the blood be abated, and ſharp humours allay'd, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100351:73"/> and dulcifi'd, as the Experience of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the two Summers laſt paſt eſpecially ſeem to teſtifie; I know nothing elſe in the Waters I can attribute this effect with greater juſtice to, than this impalpable powder, which like Coral and Pearls, being in themſelves gritty and inſipid, are known to produce the ſame effects without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the body, by imbibing the Acrimony, or altering the property of thoſe humors they are found to allay. I confeſs indeed, ſome expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might in reaſon be of a fermentation within, as by the means of this powder, in good part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there probably hath been without in the Waters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, according to my Hypotheſis mentioned in the former Chapter, if the Powder were ſeparated and immediately mixed with acids in the Bowels, Stomach, Spleen, or elſewhere, upon which, Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, Inflations, and other inconveniences might enſue; but the Water paſſing quickly off, and there being not that conſtant ſupply as underground, nor proportionable acids neither, as may be there, no ſuch ill effects can reaſonably be fear'd, nor yet have been obſerv'd.</p>
                        <p>As to <hi>Bitumen,</hi> either Liquid or Solid, the firſt of which is chiefly condemned by Mineral Writers, no inconvenience can ariſe from that, in regard I do not conceive it mixed, or indeed capable of mixing with the body of the Waters, but is at ſome certain times eructed from the Springs, chiefly in the Months of <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it aſcends, being driven through the Waters, without mixture, to the ſurface, and there remains as a Scum, which taken off and dried burns like Stone-pitch, and is noted elſewhere:<note place="margin">See Obſ. <hi>100.</hi>
                           </note> So that the quantity being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to any other of the Minerals, and the times of breeding and appearing not conſtant, with
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100351:73"/> an incapacity of mixing with the body of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, otherwiſe certainly it would not aſcend and float on the ſurface as we find it doth: theſe things, I ſay, conſidered, I cannot but think it ſtrange, the Learned Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi> ſhould aſſert theſe Baths to be Bituminous <hi>à praedominio,</hi> or conſiſt principally of Bitumen, which I ſhall hereafter make appear to be but a leſs principal Principle, and rather an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance to, than an Ingredient in the waters. So much alſo I muſt further ſay, That the ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of a Bituminous ſubſtance on the ſurface of the waters; the ſhrivelling of the tops of the fingers in the Bath; and the bare ſmell of Sulphur by the Baths-ſide; are no maſculine foundations for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting thoſe Principles, and making <hi>that</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ingredient in the waters, that is not capable of mixing with them.</p>
                        <p>Whereas <hi>Sulphur</hi> (the third Ingredient of Dr. <hi>Jorden,</hi> and leaſt proportionable,<note place="margin">N. B. <hi>Ch.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 150.</note> affirming the Baths to conſiſt principally of Bitumen, with Nitre and ſome Sulphur) is in much greater proportion than the Bitumen mentioned but now, and contains, I judge, near a fourth part of the courſer Contents, the reſult of evaporation, for ſo much or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts is loſt in Calcination, this, I ſay, though much in quantity, cannot relax or effeminate, either by fattineſs or otherwiſe, as ſome Authors pretend; for, whatever it may have of that, 'tis certainly ſo much alter'd by the other Ingredients into whoſe boſom it is taken, and to which it is ſo nearly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, that nothing of that nature doth appear at any time, and is in nothing diſcovered more than its inflammability. We ought therefore here to expect the known vertues and benefits of Sulphur, to befriend the Lungs, to comfort and cheriſh weak parts, and do all thoſe good offices we experience
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100351:74"/> in a Compoſition though made of many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, rather than to imagine the Water of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Salmacis,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Salmacis,</hi> fons Cariae limpidiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, juxta <hi>Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſium;</hi> eo nomine olim malè audiens, quòd la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantium in eo, aut ex eo bibenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um corpora effoemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus.</hi>
                           </note> to be continued hither, or be fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any <hi>Sardanapalian</hi> nature in Sulphur, which may create inconveniences we know not what. But if any perſon, notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid to the contrary, may be in ſome ſuſpicion of any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cument from the Sulphur, he may have a Salt made out of the Waters to be diſſolved in it, in which Sulphur is not concern'd, and ſo the Waters may be drank in leſſer proportion.</p>
                        <p>Having therefore combated theſe three ſuppoſed Enemies to the Waters inward uſe, and found them weak and inſufficient to maintain the oppoſition they pretend to, the greater confirmation will accrue from the conſideration of the three-fold encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ariſing from the mixture of the triple Salt, Nitre, Salt and Vitriol, the further enlargement on which I ſhall at preſent forbear, and now give ſome few directions for the Patient's benefit I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</p>
                        <p>The firſt of which is, That 'tis very neceſſary the Body be well prepar'd before the Waters be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and conſequently that good advice be had whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be proper or no, for the inconſiderate uſe of any thing muſt be very prejudicial; and the beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many Effects are not produc'd, is becauſe in reaſon they could not be expected. This prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt be made, not ſlightly with a little Bath-water and Salt, Syrup of Roſes, and Manna, and ſuch like alimentary Medicines, but with proper, effectual, and frequent Purgations, as the knowing Phyſician will think requiſite ſometimes. For what Impurities are <hi>in primis viis,</hi> the Stomach, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will certainly with the Current be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried further into the Body, defile the blood, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100351:74"/> thereby create an Iliad of evils; whereas if the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be well prepar'd, the Water hath beſides a cleaner paſſage, a more free one too, unto the parts it muſt relieve.</p>
                        <p>'Tis alſo leſs beneficial for the Patient to drink the Water in the Bath, and contrary to the rules and directions of intelligent Phyſicians; but if thirſt be troubleſom, ſomewhat may be taken to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay that, and half an hour before riſing a quantity may be drank, and the reſt in bed, if occaſion ſhall require; otherwiſe to ſet aſide ſome time for drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, and never, during that time, to uſe the Bath at all, is what may give both Uſes due liberty to exert their operations, and not cramp or ſupplant one another, as they often do when made uſe of together.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe requiſite that a good courſe of Diet be obſerved in the uſe of the Waters, both as to Meat and Drink; that dinner be of meats of light and eaſie digeſtion, at twelve or one a clock, when the Waters have made a conſiderable paſs; and that ſupper be in good time, that the Body may be clear againſt the next morning again.</p>
                        <p>The beſt time for drinking is in the morning ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the Pump, at the place it ſelf, if it may be, otherwiſe, if near, at home, very warm, with a quarter of an hours walking after every Pint or Quart, at utmoſt; ariſing from three to ſix pints, four to eight, or five to ten, as the Body will bear, for no ſet gage can be given; and the beſt Rule is, that it ought to be taken <hi>pro Tolerantia,</hi> every one as they are able to bear, without ingurgitation, or relucting again. The number of days, 7, 14, 21, or a month, after which time I have obſerv'd the like effects not to be produc'd, as in the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſpace, and therefore none ought to uſe it longer at one ſeaſon.</p>

                        <p>To give a greater ſecurity and Credit to the drinking theſe Waters, with which I ſhall conclude this Chapter, it may be noted, That, beſides the common Diſcourſe of things within the memory of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100351:76"/> man, the Bath-water hath been order'd to be drank above an hundred years ago;<note place="margin">Jon. Bath. <hi>Aide. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 28.</note> for I find in a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian that writ concerning them, <hi>A.D.</hi> 1572. among other things, theſe directions:</p>
                        <p>About an hour after Sun-riſing in the morning, drink the Water out of the Spring; the Body afore purged, the digeſtion fulfilled, and the Bath firſt cleanſed, remaining clean ſix hours before.</p>
                        <p>So much of the Water as ſhall not be grievous to the Stomach may be drank.</p>
                        <p>The Water being drank, the Patient muſt walk gently a few paces in a temperate air.</p>
                        <p>By which it appears, how careful they were then of preparing the Body, and having the Water pure, which ought not to be leſs regarded now, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the danger will be more, and the benefit leſs, according to the right or wrong uſe of the Waters. That this was diſcontinu'd, no better reaſon, I think, can be given, than the Humour of the Times, to which alſo, a want of a due method in drinking, and a true underſtanding of the nature of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may much conduce.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Virtues of the Bath-water taken inwardly.</head>
                     <p>THat the Water, and conſequently the Salt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from it, and diſſolved in it, may not be defrauded of their juſt Commendation internally uſed by way of Potion, as well as by Bathing, or Lotion, outwardly, and that it may be rightly made uſe of in a due way and manner, without expecting more from it than in reaſon is to be done; I ſhall give a ſhort Account of the Diſtempers in which it may be profitable, and uſed with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, in General, I conceive it very proper in all Diſeaſes or Symptoms, that require cooling, cleanſing, opening, or gentle Evacuation; under which Heads are comprehended many Maladies, which I ſhall but briefly touch on, and leave the fuller diſcovery of its Virtues to experience, and a longer uſe.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall begin with the Stomach, both in regard it is the part it firſt deſcends into, and alſo, becauſe in righting that, it is a general Benefactor to the whole Body, the uſe of the Stomach being of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to every part, without which there can be no ſupply.</p>
                     <p>It muſt therefore infallibly cleanſe this uſeful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle from any impurities lodging in the Bottom or Plicatures thereof, (which may render what is taken in more foul) and prepare it the better for digeſtion of the food, on which depends the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100351:77"/> of the leſſer Univerſe, conducing much this way to the making better Chyle, purer blood, and more clear and active ſpirits, the wheels and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines of all ſenſe and motion.</p>
                     <p>The next Advantage is, That it procures an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and makes thoſe that drink it receive and enjoy their food with more delight and ſatisfaction. This is generally known to all that uſe it, and is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected partly by removing what lines the inner Coat of the Stomach with too much Viſcoſity, with which the fibres, and nervous filaments, the Organs of Senſation, are obſtructed; partly by an Eſurine quality reſiding in the Salt, provoking the deſire of Suſtenance, which we call Hunger, by its immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate application to the parts mentioned before. And in this Eſurine Quality it doth exceed Common Water, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath written, That it makes men hungry; <hi>viz.</hi> by its waſhing and cleanſing the Stomach, as is declared before; but this by the mixture of the Salt, is made more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
                     <p>A third Convenience is, That it allays Thirſt, which is often very troubleſom, and ſometimes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to take in Liquors to ſuppreſs it, that may create farther diſturbances in the Body, and prove more offenſive; whereas this, by its cooling and moiſtening nature, is the beſt Remedy that can be provided, and that in no great proportion neither, as hath been often experimented.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo of good uſe in the Heart-burning, or <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> occaſioned by the ſharpneſs and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a bilious humour, vellicating the nerves and membranes of the upper orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, called by the Ancients, by reaſon of its great communication therewith, the Heart; which ſharp and acrimonious humour it alters, waſhes off, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100351:77"/> at laſt evacuates, upon which the Paſſion ceaſeth, and eaſe doth enſue.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it clears by its immediate paſſage out of the Stomach, for ſome water, I ſuppoſe, doth paſs that way, whatever obſtructions are found in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels about the Stomach, relating either to that or the Caul, ariſing from the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and known commonly among Anatomiſts by the hard names of <hi>Venae Gaſtricae, Epiplociae,</hi> and <hi>Gaſtro-Epiplociae,</hi> conveying what is tranſmitted from the Celiack Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, to the Liver, and ſo by the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> to the Heart, according to the undoubted and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed doctrine of the Circulation.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, It is of ſingular uſe in all Fluxes, whether with blood, or without; Diarrhea's, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteries, or bloody Urine; not that it hath any ſtrong aſtringent quality, which oftentimes is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, but by its abſterging and cleanſing virtue, and gently evacuative withal, it allays Acrimony, ſweeps away pungent particles, and diſcharges them by the draught. However, if aſtringent Medicines ſhall at any time be judged neceſſary, the Cure will be facilitated, and more ſpeedily performed, if the Water be drank, or uſed by Clyſter, or both ways made uſe of, before they are adviſed, which will be a good preparatory to other Remedies.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo good in the Colick, on the account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpecified, and with the addition of its Heat; inſomuch that thoſe that drink the Bath-water, are obſerved to break more wind than other people, and find great relief in that caſe.</p>
                     <p>It is proper alſo in the Diſtemper that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, though improperly, called the Heat of the Liver, when the Face is red, pimpled, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy afflicted with cholerick and puſtulous Eruptions, having its foundation in the blood, which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100351:78"/> attemperates, and brings down to a juſt degree, proportionable to the Natural and Balſamick Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of its prime Compoſure.</p>
                     <p>It opens likewiſe the obſtructions of the Liver, Spleen and Gall, and therefore proper in the Spleen, ſo far as it ariſeth from that Cauſe, and not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but very advantagious, in the Scurvy, Jaundiſe, and obſtructions of the Meſentery, which, if the Waters paſs, muſt be much advantage to the Body; in regard there moſt commonly lyes the <hi>Sentina Corporis,</hi> or Sink of the whole, which is cleanſed this way, as the Sewers in <hi>Briſtow,</hi> by St. <hi>David</hi>'s Flood.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo very beneficial, if moderately taken, in the Gravel of the Kidneys, or any Gravel or Phlegm obſtructing them, or the Ureters, which it undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably cleanſeth, and prevents Concretions, which may afterward terminate in Tophes and Stones; ſo that 'tis a good preſervative againſt the Stone, and will diſſolve what is not too firmly impacted, which may be diſcover'd, if the water paſs not freely that way.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo of incomparable uſe in the <hi>Diabetes,</hi> or piſſing Diſeaſe, which is uſually attended with a great drought, which it allays above any thing; and, the quantity moderated for fear of piſſing too much, produces great effects, as hath been experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of late by a Perſon of Honour.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not alſo to commend it in the Dropſie, but care muſt be taken that it paſs well away, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it may prove more prejudicial than advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. The like alſo may be ſaid of the Gout.</p>
                     <p>'Tis beneficial likewiſe in the Whites in Women, and what is ſomewhat conſequential, prepares them for Conception; ſo that in ſome kinds of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100351:78"/> no more effectual Medicine can be uſed. <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius dicit, Aquarum aliquas ſterilitatem foeminarum abolere, &amp; conceptus ipſis repreſentare, ſicut</hi> Sinueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanas <hi>in</hi> Campania; Theſpiarum <hi>fontis in</hi> Boeotia; Elati <hi>fluminis in</hi> Arcadia; <hi>qui effectus ſignificant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſmodi Aquas eſſe Nitroſas: Etenim hae vulvam, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam eam abſtergunt, Conceptioni faciunt habilem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Georg.

                     <p>The inward uſe is alſo very profitable in all foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Blood, the Itch, Scabs, Leproſie, and the Worms.</p>
                     <p>For the Diſtempers of the Head it may be leſs uſeful, being ſomewhat remote, yet in many not prejudicial; for the fore-quoted Author ſays, ſpeaking of Nitrous Waters; <hi>Capita, ſuccis frigid s qui mentem obtundunt, repleta exiccantes &amp; robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, tandem mentem denuo acuere, &amp; ſanitati re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituere poſſunt. Thoſe Heads that are filled with cold humours, which dull the mind, Nitrous Waters, by their drying and corroborating faculty, do relieve; and ſharpening the underſtanding, reſtore to perfect health.</hi> Yet in regard this may be referred to the general Head of Obſtructions, as before, I ſhall ſay no more at this time of the Virtues of the Water in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: only add what <hi>Kircher</hi> ſays of Nitrous Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his Chapter of that Subject: <hi>When Nitre is</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe Virtues are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in all Nitrous Waters, according as they more or leſs parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of that Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> 
                        <hi>predominant, it makes the Water that hath imbib'd it powerful in operation; enables it to correct an ill habit of Body, which ſuch as are phlegmatick are prone to; it looſes the Belly; is good in the diſeaſes of the Nerves, and for ſuch as are ſubject to defluxions

                     </head>
                     <p>HAving in the 12th. Chapter of this Diſcourſe made ſome mention of this Water, as a neighbouring Water to <hi>Bathe,</hi> and ſuppoſed only a Continuation thither, which I did not think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable on the Reaſons there alledged; it will not be altogether improper in this place, to treat a little more largely of that, which hath a name among the uſeful Mineral Waters of this Land.</p>
                     <p>As to the Principles of this Hot-Well Water, as 'tis uſually call'd, without which the Reaſon of the Virtues can never be underſtood, they have been variouſly reported; what I have found on my own obſervation, I here declare.</p>
                     <p>On the Evaporation of two Gallons of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I had ℈v. of the Contents; of which ℈iv. were a reddiſh ferrugineous Earth, ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in colour, an Iron Ore, but in ſubſtance, very light and friable, with a mixture of a Lime-ſtone: The other ℈. which the Lixivium gave me, evaporated in Glaſs, ſeemed to be Alom, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Lime-ſtone may counterfeit Alom, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally when precipitated, I could not abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be Aluminous.</p>
                     <p>To be a little better ſatisfied, I cauſed Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Millechape,</hi> an induſtrious and skilful Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to evaporate one Hogſhead of the Water of the Hot-Well, which he did in a furnace, firſt, to three or four Gallons, afterwards finiſhed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100351:80"/> it in an evaporating Glaſs, and ſent me the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, which were little wanting of ℥v ſs. four Ounces of which were, on examination, that red, ruſty colour'd Earth, mentioned before, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, though much leſs in quantity, more white.</p>
                     <p>Upon this <hi>non</hi>-Saline part, as I call it, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the Saline part that conſtitutes the Lixivium, being put into a Crucible and calcin'd, I obſerv'd: That the red Earth was not harder, but more friable, and loſt its ruſty colour, becoming more blew; but the white being cold, and mixed with fair water, did, upon the firſt injection, hiſs, and afterwards diſſolve, leaving the water white, and a Limy reſidence in the bottom of the Veſſel I infuſed it in; and both white and blew, after infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being dryed again, became very white and limy.</p>
                     <p>The other part being Saline imbibed into a Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium, I evaporated away to half a Pint, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in a cool pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, found the next morning, it had ſhot into long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nall Stiria's, much reſembling thoſe of the Croſs Bath here, to the quantity of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iii. the remaining part of the Liquor that did not ſhoot, I breath'd away, and had ℥i. of another kind of Salt, now under examination; ſo that the Saline part is here much exceeded by the <hi>non</hi>-Saline, to which it ſeems to bear proportionably not much more than a 5th. part, and to be contained accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Eſtimate, ſcarce twelve Grains in a Gallon, whereas that of <hi>Bathe</hi> hath about forty impure.</p>
                     <p>To give then a ſhort Account of the Principles of this Water, I judg it to conſiſt of Iron, a Nitro-Sulphureous Salt, and ſome Lime-ſtone, according to the proportions before deliver'd, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100351:81"/> tents Saline, and <hi>non</hi>-Saline, to be, in all, near half as much as in the Waters of <hi>Bathe,</hi> where the Salts are a third, and here a fifth, or thereabout, as was mentioned before.</p>
                     <p>That very little of an acid is contained in theſe Waters, may appear from this, That neither the cold Water, nor a ſtrong Lixivium made of the Salt, will either turn with Galls, or coagulate Milk; neither doth any thing glebous ſhew it ſelf among the Shoots I have had yet.</p>
                     <p>What the other Salt is, which I have not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin'd, and taſts much Alcalizate, I do here promiſe to declare on another occaſion: only for the preſent, which is all I ſhall ſay of the Principles of this Water now, To make it further evident, that this is Lime-ſtone, after the <hi>non</hi>-Saline part was well calcin'd, with a ſtrong fire, in the water of that I decocted Sulphur, which it did diſſolve, and was precipitated with a fetid ſmell, both by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd Vinegar, Spirit of Vitriol, and Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, in a conſiderable quantity.</p>
                     <p>This Water then though participating of the ſame Salts with the Water of <hi>Bathe,</hi> but not in that proportion, cannot be expected to be as advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſame Diſtempers, as it is leſs hot; but containing ſo much of Iron, hath that advantage above it, and may be as effectual as <hi>Tunbridg</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in any Diſeaſes that Water is proper for, and, for ought I know, do every way as well.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of <hi>Caſtle-Cary</hi> Water.</head>
                     <p>THE Mineral Water in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by the name of <hi>Caſtle-Cary,</hi> or <hi>Alford</hi>-water, being of a quick working nature, and by ſome perſons made uſe of at <hi>Bathe,</hi> deſerves alſo an Examination; which I the rather do here, in regard it may confirm and illuſtrate what I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſcourſt of, concerning the Nature and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Baths of <hi>Bathe,</hi> to which it may be alſo very ſubſervient.</p>
                     <p>By Tryals therefore, according as I had done on the Waters of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I find it to conſiſt of ſome parts Saline, ſome <hi>non</hi>-Saline. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line part is chiefly Nitrous, Nitre being almoſt double to the other Salts; and therefore I judg this Water, <hi>Nitroſa à praedominio;</hi> Nitre appearing in a nauſeous taſte, apparent bitterneſs, cooling, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, and ſhooting into as long and firm Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's, as I have ever ſeen in the King's, or Hot Baths.</p>
                     <p>The other Salt, is common brown Salt, ariſing, I conceive, from a ſmall Rock or Mine, of that ſort of Salt in the ground about the Spring. This, I ſaid, is little more than half the proportion of the former, and ſhews it ſelf in proper Squares or Cubes, peculiar to that Salt, the Nitre ſhooting firſt, and this Salt laſt of all.</p>
                     <p>The parts <hi>non</hi>-Saline are likewiſe double:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A red Gritt, ariſing alſo from a Rock of that colour, and is the proper Gritt of the ground;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100351:82"/> next the Earth under the Sward, of which I am now to treat a little. The Earth under the ſurface of the ground is firſt, a ſtiff blew Marl: under that a white Clay: and laſt of all the Red Rock.</p>
                     <p>The Earth, the ſecond part <hi>non</hi>-Saline contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Water, is chiefly the latter, I mean the white Clay, which with the Rocky Sediment, makes up near the proportion of the brown Salt, or rather ſomewhat more, the Rock bearing not a fourth part to the Clay.</p>
                     <p>Out of 12 Gallons of this Water wanting 3 Pints, I had ℥18. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi ss. of the Contents, beſides droſs and ſcum in the depuration of the Water, of which ℥iii. Nitre; ℥i. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi. brown Salt; and ℥ii. Earth and Rock. ℥iii. gr. 30. loſt in working. So that ℥ss. of Salt is contained in every Gallon of the Water, or proportionably <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ss. in every Pint, or between 20 and 30 Grains, of which two parts are Nitre, and one brown Salt.</p>
                     <p>Note, That out of the quantity of Water men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, I had of the pure refined Salt only ℥iv. 2 Drams, and 40 Grains, in a Gallon; 20 Grains in a Pint.</p>
                     <p>This Water then muſt be of good uſe to cool, cleanſe, penetrate and attenuate groſs humours; allay acrimony; attemperate and ſuppreſs undue fermentation. Good in the Spleen, Scurvy, Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and all obſtructions of the Meſentery and Bowels, having all thoſe properties <hi>Kircher</hi> gives of Nitrous Waters, mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>It cleanſes the Kidneys and Ureters, and is very beneficial in the Stone, moving by Siege, Urine and Sweat, and that very effectually, in regard the Minerals are ſo ſtrongly imbibed, which makes it better to be mixed with the Water from the Springs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100351:82"/> at <hi>Bathe,</hi> which, having the ſame Salts are leſs, operative, becauſe leſs impregnated.</p>
                     <p>And thus having diſcours'd of Three Mineral Waters, by the Salts, the main of their Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſomewhat related, St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s <hi>Hot Well,</hi> leſs impregnated; <hi>Bathe,</hi> more; and <hi>Caſtle-Cary Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in the higheſt degree; I hope the beſt uſe will be made of them all. And ſo I take leave of this Subject for the preſent, referring the Curious to more Particulars, concerning the principal part of my Deſign, to the enſuing <hi>Century of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

                     <head>4. Doctor <hi>Edward Jorden.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>COncerning Dr. <hi>Jorden,</hi> whoſe Name is yet freſh, and memory very acceptable to all that knew him, having left the deſerved Reputation of a Learned, Candid, and Sober Phyſician: I have written ſomething heretofore, and ſhall only here again mention ſome particulars more nearly relating to his perſon and condition.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Jorden,</hi> I underſtand, was a Gentleman of a good Family, and, being a younger Brother, deſigned for a Profeſſion, for which when he had accompliſh't himſelf, by a convenient courſe of ſtudies in his own Country, he travelled abroad to ſee the Manners and Cuſtomes of the Univerſities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, and having ſpent ſome time there, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Padua,</hi> where he took the degree of Doctor in Phyſick, returned home, practiced at <hi>London,</hi> became an eminently ſolid and rational Philoſopher and Phyſician, and one of that famous and learned Society, <hi>The Kings Colledge of the Phyſicians there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had a natural inclination to Mineral works, and was at great charges about the ordering of Alom, which ſucceeding not according to expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was thereby much prejudic'd in his eſtate, as appears from theſe words in the ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Treatiſe of <hi>Nat. Bathes</hi> and <hi>Mineral Waters;</hi> Now I come to <hi>Allum (Indignum vex ipſa jubet renovare dolorem,)</hi> the greateſt debtor I have, and I the greateſt benefactor to it, as ſhall appear when I think fit to publiſh the artifice thereof. For the Patent or Grant for the profit of the Alom works, which he reaſonably did expect,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100351:102"/> fell afterwards, I know not how, to Sr. <hi>Arthur In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams</hi> lot, although the Doctor alſo had a good ſhare in the affection of King <hi>James.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After he had practiſed ſometime in <hi>London,</hi> he ſettled at <hi>Bathe,</hi> where living many years, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Children not a few, his converſation was ſo ſweet, his carriage ſo obliging, and his life ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the port and dignity of the faculty he profeſt, that he had the applauſe of the Learned, the reſpect of the Rich, the prayers of the Poor, and the love of all. But living a ſtudious and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary life, which might encourage his two grand diſtempers he labours under, the Stone and Gout, departed this life in the great Climacterical year of his age 63, and of our Saviours Nativity 1632, lying buried in the South Iſle of the Abbey Church, but without a Monument, or any Inſcription. And thus much for Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi> who was the firſt Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian that writ any thing of the Waters, that reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the place.</p>

                     <p>DOctor <hi>Lapworth</hi> was bred up in the famous Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and a member of that flouriſhing Society, <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge there, where he proceeded Doctor in a ſolemn Act in the year 1611, with two eminent Phyſicians his contemporaries, Dr. <hi>Simon Baskervill,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Clayton.</hi>

                     <p>His correſpondence was good with <hi>Jorden,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both at one time practicioners on the place, as appears from the verſes he hath prefixt to Dr. <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in <hi>Laudem operis.</hi> He had only one Daughter, who being married out of this place, cauſed his

<q>Here lieth the Body of <hi>Edward Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> Doctor in Phyſick, who deceaſed <hi>24</hi> of <hi>May, An. Dom. 1636.</hi>
                        </q> His age I gueſs was near 60. As to his gifts of Mind they are doubtleſs beyond exception, having been ſo well educated, and a profeſſour, if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake not, in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which gave ſome interruption to his practice here; being in body not tall, fat and corpulent, which inclin'd him the more to take his eaſe.</p>

He lived many years at <hi>Bathe,</hi> and had the Name of a plain, charitable Phyſician, but no ready man at ſtating a Caſe, which occaſion'd one, a little tartly, to ſay, <hi>That whereas ſome other men had,</hi> (according to the common Phraſe) <hi>Guts in their Brains;</hi> Dr. Venners <hi>Brains were in his Guts.</hi> However he found the right way to write a book called <hi>Via recta ad vitam longam,</hi> wherein is this memorable Obſervation,<note place="margin">V.R. <hi>ad</hi> V.L <hi>p.</hi> 59, <hi>l.</hi> 8.</note>

                     <p>The Author of this Epitaph, for who made it is uncertain, ſeems rather to me to have been a Divine than a Phyſician, for which conjecture I have theſe Reaſons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the form thereof is borrowed from one made on Doctor <hi>Daniel Featley,</hi> now in <hi>Lambeth,</hi> as I could clearly make appear by comparing the Expreſſions, as I have ſometime done, and for the ſatisfaction of any that deſire it, may without a journey thither, be read, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> in Doctor <hi>Featley</hi>'s Book againſt the Anabaptiſts, where it is copied, and whence it was probably taken. Now a Phyſician, I conceive, would never have taken pattern from a Divine, to make an Epitaph on his own faculty, which is proper for a Divine, being more his concern.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Venerandus</hi> is a word ſuiting better with a Divine, and a more proper Epithete than for a Phyſician, as <hi>Reverendus &amp; Venerabilis;</hi> and is moſt likely to have come from one whoſe tongue was tipp'd with ſuch language, who vvould rather chuſe to run the riſque of an impropriety in ſpeech, than loſe the honour of a jingling quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. 'Tis probable this Epitaph was made near a Church, and that either when the Bells were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100351:105"/> or elſe in imitation of that ſound, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Chime of <hi>Hoc</hi> and <hi>Illo, Horum</hi> and <hi>Illorum, His</hi> and <hi>Illis,</hi> with the great pains taken to obſerve the Cadences ſo exactly as is done.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, the word <hi>plus</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuſpicious, by which vve muſt underſtand <hi>Minus,</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>Nec plus defuit ſanis quam aegris paupe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ibus,</hi> may bear this ſenſe, and not well any other, <hi>that the Doctor was wanting both to the one and the other,</hi> vvhen the Author, I ſuppoſe, meant <hi>he was wanting to neither.</hi> Now <hi>Plus</hi> is a fit word for a divine, and might the ſooner have been made choice of for this, that 'tis the origin or ſourſe of the word <hi>Plurality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly and laſtly; No Phyſician would have uſed that Expreſſion, <hi>Theoriam unius anni confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Praxi</hi> 85, by vvhich Doctor <hi>Venner</hi> is made a Practicioner from his Mothers womb, and longer a Phyſician than St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was a Prophet, which in it ſelf being ſomewhat harſh, though ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in relation to his courſe of life, vvhere the life of that expreſſion lay, can proceed from none but a Divine, vvho oftentimes will be nibbling at Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>Again, for I reſerved ſomething for a ſecond part, That expreſſion is juſtly liable to exception, <hi>Quod Charitatem ſolus hic tamdiu exercuiſſet,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Dr. <hi>Venner</hi> is made the only Charitable perſon in <hi>Bathe,</hi> whereas there vvere then living, beſides ſome Charitable Inhabitants of another ſtamp, three or four more Phyſicians there, whoſe Charity, though perhaps not ſo rampant as Dr. <hi>Venners,</hi> was enough both in food and Phyſick to call the truth of that expreſſion into queſtion.</p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:100351:105"/>
                     <p>And although this neceſſary requiſite to every good Chriſtian that is in a condition ſo to do, be not with that oſtentation put into the Epitaph of Dr. <hi>Baue.</hi> Yet I have heard a good Character of him alſo in this kind, and do know many poor perſons now alive in <hi>Bathe,</hi> that will affirm they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good Alms and Phyſick too from his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. I confeſs <hi>Tamdiu</hi> may do ſome ſervice here, to this effect, that Dr. <hi>Venner</hi> vvas the only man that was charitable here ſo long, which, though it may abate ſomewhat, doth not take off the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of <hi>Solus,</hi> which, like the Sun, never appears without reflection. I vvrite not this to derogate from Dr. <hi>Venner,</hi> or diſparage the Epitaph, having that eſteem for both they do deſerve; but as the Devil, we ſay, ſhould have his due, ſo I think, 'tis not fitting a Saint ſhould have more. And thus much for the Charitable Dr. <hi>Venner.</hi>

                     <p>DOctor <hi>Ralph Bayly,</hi> of whom I am next to treat, was well known to all his Collegues of <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> where he had his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to be as ſtout a man as that Society hath yielded, having in his Temper an equal mixture of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> or rather, born under the <hi>praedominium</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> as he hath often evidenced when he long'd for Veniſon, though ſometimes bought at a dear rate.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Bayly</hi> was born in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> deſcended of a good Family in that County, whoſe Coat-armour is, <hi>In a field Gules, three Martlets;</hi> or, <hi>A Chief Vairy Argent of Azure.</hi> Having ſpent ſome time in <hi>Wincheſter</hi> School, that fruitful Seminary of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100351:106"/> Learning, he was in due time tranſplanted to <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he gradually proceeded with good applauſe, till he arrived at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Doctor of Phyſick, which hapned in the year 1618. By two Wives, the one a <hi>Quintin,</hi> the other a <hi>Hungerford,</hi> both comely Women; he had iſſue both Male and Female.</p>
                     <p>His eldeſt Son <hi>Walter,</hi> my intimate friend and acquaintance, he educated in the Univerſity, in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall in <hi>Oxford;</hi> but finding his genius not ſo much inclining him to Learning, though he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> great admirer of it, and had much reſpect for any Scholar that was truly ſo, and had Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough himſelf to render him facetious, and as good company as any man could wiſh; finding, I ſay, his genius not ſo much bent to ſtudy, he rather choſe a gentile Education, and being very acceptable to all perſons of Quality, eſpecially the Gentry of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> in particular Sr. <hi>Richard Gifford</hi> of <hi>Sumburne, Henry Ludlow</hi> of <hi>Tadley</hi> Eſquire, and many others, where he uſed to hunt and recreate with all the kindneſs imaginable; at laſt, on the death of his Father took to the Eſtate, and ſettled at <hi>Bathe</hi> in the ſame houſe the Doctor enjoy'd, where he lived plentifully many years, and ſaw an end of all his Generation, till at length, for Death is the end as well of the good Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Sot, of a lingring diſtemper, being much obſtructed in the Meſentery and Urinary paſſages; he ended this life about the ſixtieth year of his age, on the 15 day of <hi>November, An. Dom.</hi> 1672, and is buried in the Abbey Church in <hi>Bathe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Bayly</hi> is further remarkable in this, that he is the only man ſave one, of any Phyſician that lived here; that had a Son of his own Profeſſion, which was Mr. <hi>Thomas Bayly,</hi> by his ſecond Wife
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100351:106"/> Mrs. <hi>Hungerford,</hi> an Ingenious man, and good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, of whom his Brother would often ſpeak with much affection and reſpect, who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Wars, when no Acts were kept, was with many others, created Doctor <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1642, and practiſing at <hi>Newbury</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> with good ſucceſs and reputation, died of a high infection in the prime of his years, not long after. He was much encouraged to the Delivery of Women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitted for that ſervice both by art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo further obſervable in Doctor <hi>Ralph Bayly,</hi> that although he had good practiſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to many Patients, yet ſuch was his good Temper of Nature, and Temperance withal, that he never took any Phyſick himſelf, or made uſe of the Bath, being never ſick in all his life; which fell the heavier on him, according to the vulgar obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for going from his houſe at <hi>Bathe</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had at <hi>Widcombe,</hi> a mile diſtant, he was ſuddenly taken with a great faintneſs, inſomuch as he was conſtrained to call at a Neighbours houſe before he came to his own, to deſire ſomething to refreſh him, uſing theſe words, <hi>as God ſhall mend me,</hi> which was his uſual ſaying, <hi>I am ill,</hi> and preſently departed, and was buried at <hi>Widcombe,</hi> Nov. 16. 1645.</p>
                     <p>He was a proper, Comely perſon, charitable, and well read in the Ancient learning, witneſs a good Collection of old Authors, well markt with his own Hand, now in my poſſeſſion. And ſo much for Dr. <hi>Ralph Bayly,</hi> being the only man, I think, that ever liv'd and dy'd without pain.</p>

                     <p>He was alſo very happy in, the glory of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, the Cure of Chronical diſtempers, which he effected chiefly by Chalybeat Medicines, which, he was wont to ſay, were as true as Steel; but a little too much addicted to the vanity of <hi>Noſtrums,</hi> which he being many times unwilling to diſcover, cauſed ſome diſlike on conſultation with others.</p>

                     <p>He was by Nature not ſo affable, but ſomewhat moroſe, and hated an Emperick, though made uſe of his Medicines. In ſhort, He was an induſtrious man, an able Phyſician, and much in the favour of that great Phyſician of his Time Sir <hi>Theodore May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern,</hi> between whom many Letters paſſed, on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Patients, chiefly French.

                     <p>DOctor <hi>John Maplet</hi> was born in <hi>London,</hi> bred at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-School, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was firſt Proctor of the Univerſity, then Doctor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, in the year<note n="*" place="margin">When he had his Grace, but kept no Act till <hi>1654.</hi>
                        </note> 1647. and after that Principal of <hi>Gloceſter-Hall;</hi> a man well accompliſht as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a Scholar, meek, ſober, and temperate, beloved and reſpected by all that knew him.</p>
                     <p>While he was in the Univerſity, he had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by accompanying the Lord Viſcount <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to whom he was Tutor, to Travel, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly went in the year 1650. into <hi>France,</hi> where he continued near two years, chiefly at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, Bloys</hi> and <hi>Saumur,</hi> and made many Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on thoſe Countreys, which he committed to Writing in a neat and curious Hand, in ſome Epiſtles now with me, with a particular Tract of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, in an elegant Latin Style, which I may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other make publick, and do further right to the memory of this Worthy Perſon.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond time he Travell'd into <hi>Holland</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> with my Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> then Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, on the death of his elder Brother, whom before he had accompanied into <hi>France,</hi> the young
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100351:110"/> Lord <hi>Scudamore,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Jones,</hi> who loſt his life by an unfortunate Shot at the late Siege of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and at his return, or ſhortly after, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Mrs. <hi>Anne Hull</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where he uſually practiſed in the Winter time, and at <hi>Bathe</hi> in the Summer.</p>
                     <p>And although he left a good Eſtate, conſidering the ſmall time he had for practice, dying not old, and ſpending much of his time at firſt abroad, yet I muſt ſay, he had no right done him, by one that pretended much kindneſs to him,<note place="margin">

But ſeeing that Cunning Fox is now earth'd, I ſhall not dig af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; but proceed to ſome other Particulars, of no Vulpone alike under ground.</p>
                     <p>He was of a tender, brittle Conſtitution, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to feminine, clear skin'd, and of a very freſh Complexion, and though very temperate, as I ſaid before, yet inclinable to Rheumatick Diſtempers, chiefly Gouts and Catarrhs, which would often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confine his Body, but not his Mind, which was then more at liberty to expatiate, and give ſome invitation to his Poetick Genius, which was very good, to deſcant on the Tormenter, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute his Sorrow into a Scene of Mirth.

                     <p>MR. <hi>John Dauntſey</hi> was a Gentleman of a good extraction, and younger Son, as I have heard, to a Knight, who having been bred a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, was encouraged to the practiſe of Phyſick by Dr. <hi>Jorden,</hi> for vvhom Mr. <hi>Dauntſey</hi> had a great eſteem, as appears by his Verſes on Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi>'s Treatiſe. He vvas a man of great integrity, but made no conſiderable advance in the World. He died ancient near 80, in the year 1650, and vvas buried in the Abbey Church, <hi>Febr.</hi> 12. He married a Gentlewoman of a good family, one Mrs. <hi>Winter,</hi> by whom he had beſides other Children, Mr. <hi>John Dauntſey</hi> his eldeſt Son, who practiſed Phyſick with good ſucceſs in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and died lately; and another now living a Chirurgeon.</p>

                     <p>There was an Epitaph made on him by one known by the name of Dr. <hi>Somerſchall,</hi> a Chymiſt, vvho if no better Chymiſt than Poet, was never like to attain the liquor <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> or the Philoſophers <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum,</hi> vvhich, becauſe I am inform'd, it was put on Mr. <hi>Dauntſey</hi>'s Tombſtone by this Philoſopher (of vvhich I have ſeen ſome marks) I have through his means made ſo great a progreſs as to know where the Philoſophers Stone is, though but little legible on it now, vvhereupon, as greater Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have been in this ſearch, I was fruſtrated of my expectation; however the Verſes were in part theſe, or to this purpoſe:

                     <p>MR. <hi>Thomas Brewer</hi> vvas born in the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> vvhere there are now of that name related to him, of good Eſtates; an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious man, a good Scholar, and expert Phyſician, as I have underſtood by his preſcriptions. He was well acquainted vvith the Greek and Latin Tongues, and excellent in the former, vvhich is ſo rare among many pretenders to the faculty now, that <hi>Graecum eſt, non poteſt legi,</hi> may be made uſe of again, and therefore this inſtance of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought not to be omitted. He lived many years in good eſteem, and is buried in the Abbey Church vvith this Inſcription on a piece of braſs on his Tombſtone: <hi>Here lieth the Body of</hi> Thomas Brewer, <hi>late of the City of</hi> Bathe <hi>Phyſician, who departed this life the third of</hi> November, <hi>An.
